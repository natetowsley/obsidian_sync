# Unordered Lists
- If you want to have a list of items where the order doesn't matter, like a shopping list that can be bought in any order, then you can use an unordered list
- Created using the `<ul>` element
- Each item within the list is created using the list item element `<li>`
- In an unordered list, each list item begins with a bullet point
```html
<ul>
	<li>Item 1</li>
	<li>Item 2</li>
	<li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

# Ordered Lists
- If you instead want to create a list where the order *does* matter, like step by step instructions, then you can use an ordered list
- Created using the `<ol>` element
- Each item within the list is created using the list item element`<li>`
- In an ordered list, each list item begins with a number
```html
<ol>
	<li>Item 1</li>
	<li>Item 2</li>
	<li>Item 3</li>
</ol>
```
