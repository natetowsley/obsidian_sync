# Elements and Tags
- Almost all elements on an HTML page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags
- Opening tags are the start of an HTML element
	- Comprised of a keyword in angle brackets `<>`
- Closing tags tell the browser where an element ends
	- Almost the same as opening tags, but have a forward slash before the keyword
- A full paragraph element would look like this:
```html
<p>some text content</p>
```
- `<p>` is the opening tag
- `</p>` is the closing tag
## HTML Elements Reference
- HTML has many predefined tags used to create all kinds of different elements

## Void Elements
- Some HTML elements do not have a closing tag, rather just a single tag
	- EX: `<br>`, `<img>`
