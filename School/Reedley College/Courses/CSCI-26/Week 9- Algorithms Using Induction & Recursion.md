## Recursive Algorithms
- A **recursive algorithm** is an algorithm that calls itself
    - These calls to itself are known as **recursive calls**

## Induction and Recursive Algorithms
- Induction is a useful proof technique to prove facts about recursive algorithms such as establishing that a recursive algorithm gives the correct output for every possible valid input
    - First prove the base case works correctly
    - Inductive step then shows that the algorithm returns the correct value assuming that all of the recursive calls return the correct values

## Analyzing the Time Complexity of Recursive Algorithms
### Deriving the Recurrence Relation
- The **time complexity** of an algorithm is a function $T(n)$ indicating the number of atomic operations performed by the algorithm on an input of size $n$
    - For a recursive algorithm, the function $T(n)$ is defined recursively by a recurrence realtion and initial values

## Divide and Conquer Algorithms: Introduction and Mergesort
- A **divide-and-conquer** algorithm solves a problem recursively by breaking the original input into smaller subproblems of roughly equal size
- Follow three basic steps
    - Break the input into smaller subproblems of the same type on smaller inputs
    - Solve each subproblem recursively
    - Combine the solutions of the subproblems to obtain a solution to the original problem
### Divide and Conquer FindMin

## MergeSort
- A **sorting algorithm** takes as input a list of items and returns the same list sorted in ascending orderâ€™
- **MergeSort** is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts a list of items recursively by dividing the list into two sub-lists of roughly half the size, recursively sorting each sub-list, and merging the sorted sub-lists
![[image 17 8.png|image 17 8.png]]
## The Queue Data Structure
- A **data structure** is a way of organizing data in a computers so that the data can be accessed and updated efficiently
- A **queue** maintains items in an ordered list
    - New items can be added to one end of the queue called the **back**
    - Items can be removed from the other end of the queue called the **front**
**Simulating Operations on a Queue**
![[image 18 8.png|image 18 8.png]]
## The Merge Operation
- The input to the **Merge** operation are two sorted lists, A and B
- The output is a single list C that contains all the items from A and B in sorted order

## Divide and Conquer Algorithms: Binary Search
- The goal of a **search algorithm** is to find a target item in a list
- **Binary Search** is an efficient algorithm to serarch for a target item in a sorted list
### Recursive Binary Search
- A recursive version of binary search takes two additional input values, _**low**_ and _**high**_
- If $n$ is the number of items in the list, then variables low and high must be in the range 1 throug hn and must satisfy the inequality low â‰¤ high
**Setting Variable low and high in Binary Search**

## Solving Linear Homogeneous Recurrence Relations
- A sequence that models a dynamical sstem is often described naturally by a recurrence relation
- Consider the Fibonacci sequence defined by the initial values and recurrence given below
![[image 22 7.png|image 22 7.png]]
- The method described in this section can be used to derive the following explicit formula corresponding to Fibonacciâ€™s recursively defined sequence
![[image 23 7.png|image 23 7.png]]
- Finding an explicit formula for a recursively defined sequence is called **solving a recurrence relation**
### Verifying an Expression Satisfies a Recurrence Relation
![[image 24 7.png|image 24 7.png]]
### Linear Homogeneous Recurrence Relations
- Each number in a sequence defined by a **linear homogeneous** recurrence relation is a linear combination of numbers that occur earlier in the sequence
![[image 25 7.png|image 25 7.png]]
- In a **homogeneous** recurrence relation, the expression for $f_n$ contains no additional terms besides the ones that refer to earlier numbers in the sequence
**Examples Illustrating Linear and Nonlinear Recurrence Relations**

## Solving Linear Nonhomogeneous Recurrence Relations
### The Associated Homogeneous Recurrence Relation
- A **nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation** is a linear recurrence relation with additional terms that are either a constant or a function of $n$
- The recurrence relations below are all examples of nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relations
![[image 28 7.png|image 28 7.png]]
- The **associated homogeneous recurrence relation** is the recurrence relation with the additional nonhomogeneous terms dropped
![[image 29 7.png|image 29 7.png]]
### Particular and Homogeneous Solutions
- The solution to a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation is the sum of two parts: a **homogeneous solution** plus a **particular solution**
- If the sequence is $\{f_n\}$, then the homogeneous solution is denoted by $f_n^{(h)}$ and the particular solution is denoted by $f_n^{(p)}$
