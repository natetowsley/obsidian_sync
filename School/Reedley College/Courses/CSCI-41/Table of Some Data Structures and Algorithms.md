# Basic Data Structures
|Data Structure|Description|
|---|---|
|Record|A **record** is a data structure that stores subitems, often called fields, with a name associated with each subitem.|
|Array|An **array** is a data structure that stores an ordered collection of elements, where each element is directly accessible by a positional index|
|Linked List|A **linked list** is a data structure that stores an ordered list of items in nodes, where each node stores data and has a pointer to the next node|
|Binary Tree|A **binary tree** is a data structure in which each node stores data and has up to two children, known as a left child and a right child|
|Hash table|A **hash table** is a data structure that stores unordered items by mapping (or hashing) each item to a location in an array|
|Heap|A **max-heap** is a tree that maintains the simple property that a nodeâ€™s key is greater than or equal to the nodeâ€™s childrensâ€™ keys. A **min-heap** is a tree that maintains the simple property that a nodeâ€™s key is less than or equal to the nodeâ€™s childrensâ€™ keys|
|Graph|A **graph** is a data structure for representing connections among items, and consists of vertices connected by edges. A **vertex** represents an item in a graph. An **edge** represents a connection between two vertices in a graph|

- An **algorithm** descirbes a sequence of steps to solve a computational problem or perform a calculation
    - **coamputational problem:** Specifies an input, a question about the input that can be answered using a computer, and the desired output
