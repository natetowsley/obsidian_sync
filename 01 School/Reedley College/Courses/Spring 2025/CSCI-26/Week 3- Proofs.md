# 3.1
## Mathematical Definitions
- **Parity:** Whether a number is odd or even
    - If two numbers are both even or both odd, then the two numbers have the same parity
    - If one is odd and the other is even, then the two have opposite parity
- **Rational Numbers:** If there exist integers **x** and **y** such that y does not equal 0 and r = x/y
  
# 3.2
## Introduction to Proofs
- **Theorem:** A statement that can be proven to be true
- **Proof:** A series of steps that follow logically from assumptions or from previously proven statements, with a final step that results in the statement of the theorem being proven
- **Axioms**: Statements assumed to be true
  
# 3.3
## Best Practices and Common Errors in Proofs
- Proof example using best practices

# 3.4
## Writing Direct Proofs
- In a **direct proof** of a conditional statement, the hypothesis _**p**_ is assumed to be true and the conclusion _**c**_ is proven as a direct result of the assumption
