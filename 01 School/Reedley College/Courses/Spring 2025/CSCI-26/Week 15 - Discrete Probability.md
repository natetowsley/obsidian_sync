## Probability of an Event
- Algorithms can be designed to make random choices in order to avoid actions that correlate badly with input data
	- Probability theory is used to analyze the behavior and running time of randomized algorithms
- Computer systems are often simulated and tested using randomized models for user behavior
- A computer chip manufacturer need to predict the likelihood that a chip contains a defect depending on different features of the fabrication environment
	- Probability theory is used to analyze different environments and predict this likelihood
- Probability is one of the primary tools in machine learning, in which computers are used to discover patterns and rules in large sets of data
	- Bayes' theorem about conditional probabilities provides a way to reason formally about the likelihood of different causes given a set of observed data
### Experiments and Outcomes
- An ***experiment*** is a procedure that results in one out of a number of possible ***outcomes***
- The set of all possible outcomes is called the ***sample space*** of the experiment
	- A subset of the sample space is called an ***event***
### Discrete vs. Continuous Probability
- ***Discrete Probability*** is concerned with experiments in which the sample space is a finite or countably infinite set
	- A set is ***countably infinite*** is there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the set and the integers
- An infinite set that is not countably infinite is ***uncountably infinite***

### Probability Distributions
- A ***probability distribution*** over the outcomes of an experiment with a countable sample space ***S*** is a function ***p*** from ***S*** to the set of real numbers in the interval from 0 to 1 with the property that:
