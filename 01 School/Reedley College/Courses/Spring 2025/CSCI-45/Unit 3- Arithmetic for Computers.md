## Division
### Division Example
![[image 5 23.png|image 5 23.png]]
$$\text{Dividend } = \text{ Quotient } * \text{ Divisor } + \text{ Remainder }$$
- **Dividend:** A number being divided
- **Divisor:** A number that the dividend is divided by
- **Quotient:** The primary result of a division; a number that when multiplied by the divisor and added to the remainder produces the dividend
- **Remainder:** The secondary result of a division; a number that when added to the product of the quotient and the divisor produces the dividend
**A Division Algorithm**

# 3.5
## Floating Point
- **Scientific Notation:** A notation that renders numbers with a single digit to the left of the decimal point
![[image 7 17.png|image 7 17.png]]
- **Normalized:** A number in floating-point notation that has no leading 0s
- **Floating Point:** Computer arithmetic that represents numbers in which the binary point is not fixed
### Floating-Point Representation
- **Fraction:** The value, generally between 0 and 1, placed in the fraction field. The fraction is also called the _mantissa_
- **Exponent:** In the numerical representation system of floating-point arithmetic, the value that is placed in the exponent field
![[image 8 15.png|image 8 15.png]]
- **Overflow:** A situation in which a positive exponenet becomes too large to fit in the exponenet field
- **Underflow:** A situation in which a negative exponent becomes too large to fit in the exponent field
- **Double Precision:** A floating-point value represented in a 64-bit doubleword
- **Single Precision:** A floating-point value represented in a 32-bit word
