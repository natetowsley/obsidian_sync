# Purpose of a Computer Program
- A computer program is a set of instructions that run on a computer or other digital device
- At the machine level, the program consists of binary instructions (1s and 0s)
	- Machine code
- Most programs are written in high-level code (readable)
	- Must be translated to machine code
## Translating High-Level Code to Machine Code

#### Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
- Includes:
	- The Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
	- Java class libraries
- Purpose:
	- Read bytecode (.class)
	- Run the same bytecode anywhere with a JVM
#### Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Includes:
	- JRE
	- Java Compiler
	- Additional tools
- Purpose:
	- Compile bytecode (.java -> .class)

#### Integrated Development Environments (IDE)
- Purpose:
	- Provide a sophisticated text editor
	- Offer assistance debugging code
	- Manage projects
	- Write source code (.java)
- Examples:
	- NetBeans
	- Greenfoot and BlueJ
	- Alice
	- Eclipse
