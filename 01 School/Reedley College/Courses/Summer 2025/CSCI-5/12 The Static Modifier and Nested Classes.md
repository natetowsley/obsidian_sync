# Static Modifier
- Using instance variables, each instance of a class created with the keyword new creates a copy of all instance variables in that class
- For example, in the Employee class below, a unique copy of lastname and firstname is created for each new Employee object that is created in a Driver Class
```java
public class Employee {
	private String lastname;
	private String firstname;
		... // more code
} // end class Employee
//create two Employees in a main method
Employee e1 = new Employee("Smith", "Mary");
Employee e2 = new Employee("Jones", "Sally");
```

# Static Keyword
- Static is a keyword in Java that modifies the association of an item to a class
- Contents of a class that are identified as static are shared across all instances of the class
- This means all the instances of the class share one copy of the static items, and each have their own unique copies of instance items, or non-static items
## Static Example
- Consider initializing a static String with the value "Oracle" called myCompany that represents the employer's company
- Each instance of Employee would still have their unique instance variables, but would share the static variable

# Static Variables
- Static Variables:
	- Are also known as class variables
	- Are declared with the static keyword
	- Have only one copy in memory, as opposed to instance variables, which hold one copy per instance
	- Are shared by object instances
	- Hold the same value for all class instance
	- Public access for static variables:
		- If public, they can be modified directly by other classes
		- Consider making the variable a constant by using the keyword final to prevent modification
```java
public static final int MODEL_NUM = 883;
```
## Programming Practices & Static Variables
- Good programming practice initializes static variables with values, rather than relying on the default null and 0 values
- The values initially assigned can be changed as long as the class is active in JVM memory
- Garbage collection removes it from memory and the initial values assigned will return the next time you use it
## Declaring a Static Variable
- To declare a static variable, include the keyword static as shown below
	- Can be public, protected, or private
	- Should have assigned values, but automatically are assigned null values for class instances: an empty string or 0 for primitive numbers
	- Should act as constants with the final keyword when they use a public, protected, or default access
```java
public class Nesting {
	//declare public static variable
	public static final int MODEL_NUM = 883;
		...
} // end class nothing
```
## Changes to a Static Variable
- Static variables that are not final can be read or assigned new values by using the optional keyword this in instance methods
	- Changes by instance methods are changed for all instances
	- A change to a static variable may indicate that the class should be limited to only one object
	- This is known as the Singleton pattern
```java
private static String myCompany = "Oracle";
public void setMyCompany(String s) {
	this.myCompany = s;
} //end method myCompany
```
## Static Variable Example
- Create a class called Turtle that contains a variable named food
	- This variable is static since all of our turtles eat the same food
	- The Turtle class will have on more variable named age
	- Since each turtle is a different age, it is best to make this variable a private instance variable rather than a static one
```java
public class Turtle {
	public static String food = "Turtle Food";
	private int age;

	public Turtle(int age) {
		this.age = age;
	}// end constructor
}// end class Turtle
```
## Accessing Static Variables
- Instance variables require an instance of the class to exist before access is possible
- You can access static variables without creating an instance of the class
- In a main method, this statement would print out the variable food without any instance reference
```java
System.out.println("I feed " + Turtle.food + " to all of my turtles!");
```
### Notation to Access Static Variables
- Generally, static variables are accessed by the notation `ClassName.variableName;`

# Static Modifier and Methods
- Static or class methods exist once and are shared by all class instances
	- May be used by other class methods or instance methods based on their access modifier
	- Cannot access non-static , or instance, variables
	- Static methods can only access static variables
	- Cannot access non-static, or instance, methods
	- Static methods can only access other static methods
	- Can be redefined in subclasses
	- Can be public, protected, default, or private
- There are differences between calling an instance method versus a class (static) method
- For example:
	- You must first create an instance and then use a dot notation to call and instance method; whereas, the class name, a doe notation, and static method name calls a static method
- The static method provides a wrapper to construct an instance of a class
- When the class has a private access constructor, a static method is one of two approaches to creating an instance of the class
## Turtle Class Example
- The turtle class has a static variable that identifies the number of tanks we have available (numTanks) and an instance variable (tankNum) that tells us which tank the Turtle is in
```java
public class Turtle {
	public static String food = "Turtle Feed";
	public int age;
	public int tankNum;
	public static int numTanks = 3;
	public Turtle(int age) {
		this.age = age;
		tankNum = (int)((Math.random()*numTanks) + 1);
	}// end constructor
	public void swim() {//implementation}
	public int getAge() {return age;}
	public int getTankOfResidence() {return tankNum;}
	public static String fishTank() {return "I have " + numTanks + " fish tanks."}
}//end class Turtle
```
- `swim()` is an instance method
	- Although each turtle can swim, the turtles may swim differently depending on their age
- `getAge()` and `getTankOfResidence()` are instance, non-static methods
	- The access non-static variables
	- Static methods cannot access non-static items
- `fishTank()` is a static method and it accesses a static variable (`numTanks`)
## Creating Class Instances Using Static Methods
- Another use of static methods is for creating class instances when the class constructor access is private, and the method is part of the same class
- This is possible because the static methods is publicly accessible with private access to the class
```java
...
private Nesting() {//implementation}
...
public static Nesting getInstance() {
	Nesting nesting = new Nesting();
	return nesting;
}
...
// Instantiate a private class with a method
Nesting n1 = Nesting.getInstance();
...
```

# Static Modifier and Classes
- Static or nested classes:
	- Can exist as nested classes
	- Cannot exist as independent classes
## Static Nested Classes
- Static nested classes
	- Are implemented inside other classes, and the other classes are known as container classes
	- Can extend the behavior of the container class
	- Can be overloaded like ordinary constructors
	- The static nested class also provides the means for instantiating a containing class when its constructor is configured with private access
	- This is the second way to instantiate a class that has a restricted or private access qualifier for its class constructor
### Static Nested Classes Example
```java
public class Space {
	//Space class variables
	public static class Planet {
		//planet class variables and constructors
		public Planet() {
			//implementation
		}//end constructor
	}//end class Planet

	//more space class implementation
}//end class Space
```
