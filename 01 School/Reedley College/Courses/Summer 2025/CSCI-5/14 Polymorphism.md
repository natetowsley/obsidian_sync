# Review of Inheritance
- When one class inherits from another, the subclass "is-a" type of the superclass
- Objects of a subclass can be referenced using a superclass reference, or type
## Learn More
- Visit Oracle's tutorial pages to learn more:
	- [Inheritance](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/subclasses.html)
	- [Polymorphism](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/polymorphism.html)
## Inheritance Example
- If classes are created for a Bicycle class and a RoadBike class that extends Bicycle, a reference of type Bicycle can reference a RoadBike object
	- Because RoadBike "is-a" type of Bicycle, it is perfectly legal to store a RoadBike object as a Bicycle reference
	- The type of a variable (or reference) does not determine the actual type of the object that it refers to
- Therefore, a Bicycle reference, or variable, may or may not contain an object of the superclass type Bicycle since it can contain any subclass of Bicycle
```java
Bicycle bike = new RoadBike();
```

# Polymorphism
- When a variable or reference may refer to different types of objects is called polymorphism
- Polymorphism is a term that means "many forms"
- In the case of programming, polymorphism allows variables to refer to many different types of objects, meaning they can have multiple forms
- For example, because RoadBike "is-a" Bicycle, there are two possible references that define the type of object it is (Bicycle or RoadBike)
## Polymorphism and Nesting Dolls
- Polymorphism can be visualized like a set of nesting dolls:
- The set of dolls share a type and appearance, but are all unique in some way
- Each doll has the same shape, with a size determined by the doll it must fit inside of
- Each smaller doll is stored inside of the next larger doll
- Each smaller doll is stored inside of the next larger doll
- From the outside you do not see the smaller dolls, but you can open each doll to find a smaller doll inside

# Superclasses and Subclasses
- In a similar way, subclasses can "fit" within the reference type of a superclass
- A superclass variable can hold, or store, a subclass's object, while looking and acting like the superclass
## Superclass Variables
- If you "open up" a superclass variable, or invoke one of its methods, you will find that you actually have a subclass object stored inside
- For example
	- With nesting dolls, you cannot see the smaller doll until you open the larger doll
	- Its type may be ambiguous
	- When Java code is compiled, Java does not check to see what type (supertype or subtype) of object is inside a variable
	- When Java code is executed, Java will "open up" to see what type of object is inside the reference, and call methods that are of that type
# Uncertainty when Referencing Objects
- There are benefits to uncertainty when referencing different objects at compile time
- For example:
	- You write a program that calculates the different tube lengths of a bicycle frame, given a rider's measurements and type of bicycle desired (RoadBike or MountainBike)
	- You want a list to keep track of how many bike objects you have built
	- You want only one list, not two separate lists for each type of bike
	- How do you build that list? An array, perhaps?
	- What's problematic about using an array to build the list?
## Why Not Use an Array of Class Objects?
- Arrays are a collection of elements of the same type, such as a collection of integers, doubles, or Bicycles
- While it is possible to have an array of objects, they must be the same type
- This is fine for classes that are not extended
- Polymorphism solves this problem
- Since RoadBike and MountainBike are both types of Bicycle objects, use an array of Bicycle references to store the list of bikes you have built
- Either type of Bicycle can be added to this array
```java
Bicycle[] bikes = new Bicycle[size];
```

# Object References
- The Object class is the highest superclass in Java, since it does not extend another class
- As a result, any class can be stored in an Object reference
```java
Object[] objects = new Bicycle[size];
```
- In this array example, it is also valid to store our bikes in an array of Object references
- However, this makes our array type even more ambiguous, and should be avoided unless there is a reason to do so
## Overriding Methods from Object
- Since Object is the superclass of all classes, we know that all classes inherit methods from Object
- Two of these methods are very useful, such as the equals() method and the toString() method
- The equals() method allows us to check if two references are referencing the same object
- The toString() method returns a String that represents the object
- The String provides basic information about the object such as it's class, name, and a unique hashcode
## Overriding or Redefining Methods
- Although the equals() and toString() methods are useful, they are missing functionality for more specific use
- For the Bicycle class, we may want to generate a String containing the model number, color, frame type, and price
- Using the method of Object will not return this information
- The toString() method in the Object class returns a String representation of the object's location in memory
- Rather than creating a method by another name, we can override the toString() method, and redefine it to suit our needs
## Overriding Methods
- Overriding methods is a way of redefining methods with the same return type and parameters by adding, or overriding the existing, logic, in a subclass method
- Overriding is different that overloading a method
- Overloading a method means the programmer keeps the same name (i.e., toString()), but changes the input parameters (method signature)
- Overriding essentially hides the parent's method with the same signature, and its will not be invoked on a subclass object unless the subclass uses the keyword super
- Overriding does not change the parameters
- It only changes the logic inside the method defined in the superclass
## Java Tutorials on Overriding Methods
- Visit Oracle's Java tutorials for more information on overriding methods:
	- [Overriding Methods](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/override.html)

# Overriding toString()
- We can override toString() to return a String that provides information about the object instead of the location of the object in memory
	- First, start with the prototype:
```java
public String toString()
```
- There is no reason to change the return type or parameters, so we will override toString()
- Given our private data (model number, color, frame type, price) we can return the following String:
```java
return "Model: " + modelNum + " Color: " + color + " Frame Type: " + frameType + " Price: " + price;
```
- The result for our overridden toString() method:
```java
public String toString() {
	return "Model      : " + modelNum +
		   "Color      : " + color +
		   "Frame type : " + frameType +
		   "Price      : " + price;
}//end method toString
```
- It is very common and very helpful when creating Java classes to override the toString() method to test you methods and data

# Understanding the Object Model
- Polymorphism, like inheritance, is central to the object model and object-oriented programming
- Polymorphism provides for versatility in working with objects and references while keeping the object discrete or distinct
- At the heart of the philosophy, the object model turns programs into a collection of objects versus a set of tasks, encapsulating the data and creating smaller pieces of a program, rather than a single large chunk of code
## Object Model Goals
- The object model has several goals:
	- Data abstraction
	- Protecting information and limiting other classes' ability to change or corrupt data
	- Concealing implementation
	- Providing modular code that can be reused by other programs or classes

# Polymorphism and Methods
- How are the methods in the subclass affected by polymorphism?
- Remember, subclasses may inherit methods from their superclasses
- If a Bicycle variable can hold a subclasses' object type, how does Java know which methods to invoke when an overridden method is called?
- Methods called on a reference (bike) will always refer to methods within the object's (RoadBike) type
```java
Bicycle bike = new RoadBike();
```
- Imagine that our Bicycle class contains a method setColor(Color color) to set the color of the bike the rider wants
- RoadBike inherits this method
- What happens when we do the following?
```java
bike.setColor(new Color(0, 26, 150));
```

# Dynamic Method Dispatch
- Java is able to determine which method to invoke based on the type of the object being referred to at the time the method is called
- Dynamic Method Dispatch, also known as Dynamic Binding, allows Java to correctly and automatically determine which method to invoke based on the reference type and the object type

# Abstract Classes
- Is it really necessary to define a Bicycle class if we are only going to create objects of its subclasses:
	- roadBikes
	- mountainBikes?
- Abstract classes are on alternative that addresses this concern
- An abstract class is one that cannot be instantiated
	- This means that you cannot create objects of this type
	- It is impossible to create variables, or references of this type
- If we declare the Bicycle class to be abstract, we can still use the syntax below, but we cannot actually create a Bicycle object
- This means all references of type Bicycle will reference subclass objects like MountainBike or RoadBike
```java
Bicycle bike = new RoadBike();
Bicycle bike = new MountainBike();
```
- Abstract classes can contain fully-implemented methods that they "pass on" to any class that extends them
- Make a class abstract by using the keyword abstract
```java
public abstract class Bicycle
```
- Abstract classes can also declare at least one abstract method (method that does not contain any implementation)
- This mean the subclasses must use the method prototype (outline) and must implement these methods
- Abstract methods are declared with the abstract keyword
```java
abstract public void setPrice(); // TO DECLARE AS ABSTRACT, DONT USE {}
```
# Abstract Methods
- Abstract methods:
	- Cannot have a method body
	- Must be declared in an abstract class
	- Must be overridden in a subclass
- This forces programmers to implement and redefine methods
- Typically, abstract classes contain abstract methods, partially implemented methods, or fully-implemented methods
## Partially Implemented Methods
- Recall that subclasses can call their superclass's constructor and methods using the keyword super
- With abstract classes, subclasses can also use super to use their superclass's method
- Typically this is done by first overriding the superclass's method, then calling the super, or overridden method, and then adding code
- For example:
	- Let's override the equals() method from the abstract class Bicycle, which is implemented partially
	- This means that the equals() method in Bicycle is not abstract
- This compares two Bicycle objects based on price and model number
	- Note, this method overrides the equals() method from Object because it has the same parameters and return type
```java
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
	if(this.price == obj.price && this.modelNum == obj.modelNum) {
		return true;
	}
	else {
		return false;
	}//end if
}//end method equals
```
- We can override the method in our subclass MountainBike and check for equivalence on other attributes
```java
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
	if(super.equals(obj)) {
		if(this.suspension == obj.suspension){
			return true;
		}
	}//end if
	return false;
}//end method equals
```

# Subclassing Abstract Classes
- When inheriting from an abstract class, you must do either of the following:
	- Declare the child class as abstract
	- Override all abstract methods inherited from the parent class
	- Failure to do so will result in a compile-time error

# Using Final
- Although it is nice to have the option, in some cases, you may not want some methods to be overridden or to have your class extended
- Java provides a tool to prevent programmers from overriding methods or creating subclasses:
	- the keyword final
- A good example is the String class
- It is declared:
```java
public final class String {}
```
- Programmers will refer to classes like this as immutable, meaning that no one can extend String and modify or override its methods
- The final modifier can be applied to variables
- Final variables may not change their values after they are initialized
- Final variables can be:
	- Class fields
		- Final fields with compile-time constant expressions are constant variables
		- Static can be combined with final to create an always-available, never-changing variable
	- Method parameters
	- Local variables
- Final references must always reference the same object
- The object to which the variable is referencing cannot be changed
- The contents of that object may be modified
- [Oracle's Java Tutorial on Using Final](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/final.html)

# Triangle Applet Code
- The following code shows the steps involved in writing an applet with two triangles of different colors
```java
public class TrianglesApplet extends Applet {
	public void paint(Graphics g) {
		int[] xPoints = {0, 40, 80};
		int[] yPoints = {50, 0, 50};
		g.setColor(Color.blue);
		g.fillPolygon(xPoints, yPoints, 3);
		int[] x2Points = {80, 160, 0};
		int[] y2Points = {50, 140, 140};
		g.setColor(Color.black);
		g.fillPolygon(x2Points, y2Points, 3);
	}//end method paint
}//end class TrianglesApplet
```
## Triangle Applet Code Explained
- Step 1:
	- Extend Applet class to inherit all methods including paint
- Step 2:
	- Override the paint method to include the triangles
- Step 3:
	- Draw the triangle using the inherited fillPolygon method
- Step 4:
	- Draw the 2nd triangle using the inherited fillPolygon method
- Step 5:
	- Run and compile your code
