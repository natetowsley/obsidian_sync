# Java Technology
- Java is the global standard for developing and delivering embedded and mobile applications, games, web-based content, and enterprise software
- Java enables you to efficiently develop, deploy, and use exciting applications and services
- From laptops to data centers, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere!

# Java's Place in the World
- Java is one of the most widely used development languages in the world today
- Over 10 million developers say they spend at least some of their time developing in Java
- Java runs on 56 billion devices

# Java's Evolution
- Java is not standing still
- Java 8, released in 2014 brought Lambda expressions to the Java platform as well as the Stream API, optional class, and a host of other great features
- This is one of the reasons why Java 8 became the most popular version in Java's history
- Even today, it remains one of the most widely used version of Java
- But choosing Java 8 today prevents developers from gaining access to an immense amount of progress in the language, JVM, tooling, and more
### Who is in Charge?
- Oracle is the steward of the Java Programming language that is now considered open source
- Oracle is not the only source for updates
- The focus for updates is on:
	- Readability
	- Simplicity
	- One language with the same meaning everywhere
- Java has moved to a 6-month, time-based release cadence with a new feature release of Java becoming available like clockwork every March and September

# The Story of Java
- In 1990, Sun Microsystems began a research project to extend the power of network computing to consumer devices, such as video cassette recorders (VCRs) and televisions
- The belief was that the next wave in computing was the union of digital consumer devices and computers
- There were also frustrations with the use of the C/C++ language at Sun
- The Green Team, a team of highly skilled software developers at Sun under the leadership of James Gosling, developed Java (originally called Oak) as their solution
	- Devices with different CPUs could be connected and share the same software enhancements through a single programming language
- This initial concept was ahead of its time, as several deals with consumer device companies were unsuccessful
- The Green Team was forced to find another market for their new programming language
- Fortunately, the World Wide Web was becoming popular and the Green Team recognized that the Oak language was perfect for developing web multimedia components to enhance webpages
- Initially, the Oak language was used for small applications, called applets, and programmers using the internet adopted what eventually became the Java programming language
- The turning point for Java came in 1995, when Netscape incorporated Java into its browser
- Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010

# Duke, the Java Mascot
- Duke is Java's official mascot
- The original Duke was created by the Green Team's graphic artist, Joe Palrang

# Java Version History
## Sun Microsystems Releases
- JDK Alpha and Beta were released in 1995, followed by JDK 1.0 in 1996
	- JDK 6.0 was released in 2006
## Oracle Releases
- Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010, and released JDK 7 in 2011, and JDK 8 in 2014
- Since JDK 11, Oracle released long-term support (LTS) versions of JDKs every 3 years, with JDK 11 in 2018, and JDK 17 in 2022

# Java Technology Product Groups
- There are four Java technology product groups and their target device types:
	- Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE)
	- Jakarta EE, formerly Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE)
	- Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME)
	- Java Card
## Target Device Types

### Java SE
- Is used to develop applications that run on desktop computers
![[Pasted image 20250527091420.png|350]]
### Jakarta EE
- Is used to create large enterprise, server-side, and client-side distributed applications
![[Pasted image 20250527091524.png|350]]
### Java ME
- Is used to create applications for devices with limited storage, display, and power capacities
- Is used to develop applications for mobile phones, PDAs, TV set-top boxes, smart cards, Raspberry Pi, and many more
![[Pasted image 20250527091653.png|350]]
### Java Card
- 5 billion Java Cards are in use
	- It's used to create applications that can run securely on smart cards and similar small-memory devices
- Java Card is typically used in the following areas (and many more)
	- Identity
	- Security
	- Transactions
	- Mobile Phone SIMs
