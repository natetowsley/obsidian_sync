# What is Inheritance?
- Inheritance is a simple but powerful tool of object oriented languages that allows classes to inherit methods and fields from other classes
- Inherit means to receive or obtain something from your predecessor or parent
- In Java, the concept of inheritance is similar to genetics
	- Genes and genetic traits are passed down from parent to child
	- Children often look and act like their parents as a result

# Superclass Versus Subclass
- Classes can derive from or evolve out of parent classes, which means they contain the same methods and fields as their parents, but can be considered a more specialized form of their parent class
- The difference between a subclass and a superclass is as follows:

| **Superclass**                                                                | **Subclass**                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The more general class from which other classes derive their methods and data | The more specific class that derives or inherits from another class (the superclass) |
- Superclasses contain methods and fields that are passed down to all of their subclasses
- Subclasses:
	- Inherit methods and fields of their superclasses
	- May define additional methods or fields that the superclass does not have

# Inheritance Example
- Create a Shape class with a variable, color, and one method which returns the color
	- Create a Rectangle class which inherits the variable and method from Shape, and can have its own methods and variables
```
Shape (superclass)
	public String color
	public String getColor

Rectangle (subclass)
	public String color
	public String getColor() //FROM SUPERCLASS

	//Rectangle-only data
	public int length
	public int width
	public int getLength()
	public int getWidth()
```

# extends Keyword
- In Java, you have the choice of which classes you want to inherit from by using the keyword extend
- The keyword extend allows you to designate the superclass that has methods you want to inherit, or whose methods and data you want to extend
- For example, to inherit from the Shape class, use extends when the Rectangle class is created
```java
public class Rectangle extends Shape {
	// code
} // end class Rectangle
```
## extends Keyword Example
- We want the Crab class to extend the methods and data in Animal and inherit methods like move(), turn(), etc.
	- Because the Animal class is extended, you can call the move() and turn() methods even though they do not appear within the Crab class code
```java
public class Crab extends Animal {
	public void act() {
		move(1);
		turn(90);
	}//end method act
}// end class Crab
```

# The Rule of Single Inheritance
- Single inheritance means that you cannot declare or extend more than one superclass per class
- The following code will not compile:
```java
public class Crab extends Animal, Crustacean, ...
```
## Extending More than One Class
- Why can't we extend more than one class?
	- Since superclasses pass down their methods and data to all of their subclasses and the subclasses of their subclasses, it isn't really necessary to extend more than one class

# More About Inheritance
- Inheritance is a one way street
	- Subclasses inherit from superclasses, but superclasses cannot access or inherit methods and data from their subclasses
	- This is just like how parents don't inherit genetic traits like hair color or eye color from their children

# Object: The Highest Superclass
- Every superclass implicitly extends the class Object
- Object:
	- Is considered the highest and most general component of any hierarchy
	- It is the only class that does not have a superclass
	- Contains very general methods which every class inherits
## Object Example 1
- Object contains methods that can be used on every class (such as toString(), or equals())
- For example, after you create a class and construct an instance of it, can you call the method toString() on your object?
```java
A_Class class = new A_class();
class.toString();
```
- Yes
	- Even though you did not write the method toString(), it is still legal for you to call this method because it was inherited from Object
## Object Example 2
- Is class.toString() legal if A_Class explicitly extends Another_Class, a superclass?
- Yes
- This is also legal since the superclass of A_Class extends Object

# Why Use Inheritance?
- The central benefit to inheritance is code reuse
- Inheriting methods from a superclass gives your class access to the code and data of the superclass
- You will not have to write the code twice, which saves you time and optimizes your code
- Also, fewer bugs occur

# Inheritance Hierarchies
- In many situations, it's common to classify concepts as hierarchies
	- A hierarchy is a way of categorizing the relationship among ideas, concepts or things with the most general or all-encompassing component at the top and the more specific, or the component with the narrowest scope, at the bottom
	- Hierarchies are a useful concept when it comes to inheritance and can be used to model an organize the relationship among superclass and subclass
## Tree Diagrams
- Hierarchies can be organized into tree diagrams
	- Computer scientists will often refer to trees having leaves and branches, or will refer to the "leaves" as nodes
	- For example, shapes can be categorized by different properties, such as their number of sides
![[Pasted image 20250616100345.png|550]]
- Notice that Circle, Triangle, and Rectangle all have a different number of sides, so they are different branches in the tree
- Only nodes with the same properties will occupy the same branch
### Type of Parent Nodes
- Anything below a node on the tree is a type of parent node
- We know that Square is a type of Rectangle
- Triangle, Rectangle, and Circle are all types of shapes
## "Is-a"
- With class hierarchies, you can use the phrase "is-a" to describe a hierarchical relationship
- A node on a branch can be thought of as the same type as the node on the root
- Example: A Rectangle "is-a" Shape, since it has all of the properties of a shape
- To model relationships among classes, we use UML
# Unified Modeling Language: UML
- Computer scientists model inheritance hierarchies using a modeling language called Unified Modeling Language, or UML
- UML is a ways of describing the relationships among classes in a system, or graphical representation of a system
- UML was developed by Grady Booch, James Rumbaugh, and Ivar Jacobson, and is standardized so it can be understood across languages
## Basic Components of UML
- Inheritance hierarchies can be modeled simply with UML
- A few simple components are required to start:
	- Class diagram:
		- Shows the name of the class, and any important data or methods within the class
	- Arrows and lines:
		- Show one class's relationship to other classes
## Class Diagram in UML
- A class can be drawn as a box that contains the class name, instance variables, and methods
- Classes can also be drawn as simple boxes with just the class name, although including methods is helpful
- It is not necessary to include every attribute or those that represent collections of data (such as arrays) Include only the most helpful attributes
![[Pasted image 20250616101146.png|450]]
## More Details About UML
- UML is a helpful tool for you to plan out how to organize multilevel class hierarchies
- You are encouraged to use UML for coding projects
- [More on UML](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/jdev/gettingstartedwithumlclassmodeling-130316.pdf)
## Showing Inheritance in UML
- Class diagrams are connected using lines with arrows
- Connecting lines vary depending on the relationship among classes
- For inheritance, a solid line and a triangular arrow are used to represent the "is-a" relationship

# Encapsulation
- Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object oriented programming
## How Encapsulation Works
- In object-oriented programming, encapsulation encloses, or wraps, the internal working of a Java instance/ object
- Data variables, or fields, are hidden from the user of the object
- Methods can provide access to the private  data or work with the data, but methods hide the implementation
- Encapsulating you data prevents it from being modified by the user or other classes so that the data is not corrupted
## How Encapsulation is Used
- Encapsulation can be used to protect sensitive data, such as personal information, by preventing the data from being changed, except within the scope of the class itself
- Data is protected and implementation is hidden by declaring access modifiers on variables and methods
- Access modifiers (public, private, protected, "default") are keywords that determine whether or not other classes can access the data or methods of the class

# Access Modifiers
- Programmers can customize the visibility of their data and methods with several levels of access modifiers

| **Access Modifier** | **Accessed by:**                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `public`            | Any class in any package                                                                          |
| `private`           | Only to other methods within the class itself                                                     |
| `protected`         | All subclasses and all classes in the same package                                                |
| "default"           | Any class in the package<br>Actually when no keyword is specified<br>The word default is NOT used |
## Declaring Access Modifiers
- The general rule for declaring access modifiers is that any data you want to protect from being altered by other classes, or data that is sensitive, should be declared private
- This includes variables
- Methods are generally declared as public so other classes can use them
- However, methods can be declared private when they are meant to be used only by the class itself
### Declaring Access Modifiers Example
- If the Shape class contained data for color, the data in this class should be private
```java
public class Shape {
	private String color;

	public Shape(String color) {
		this.color = color;
	}// end constructor method
}// end class Shape
```

# Member Access
- Use the keyword private to hide data that only the class should be able to change (This is the recommended access modifier)
- If access to the data is needed, then a getter method should be written to achieve this
- If private variables need to be (or are allowed to be) changed, then a setter method should be written
```java
public class Shape {
	private String color;

	public Shape(String color) {
		this.color = color;
	}// end constructor method
	public String getColor() {
		return color;
	}
	public void setColor(String color) {
		this.color = color;
	}
}// end class Shape
```
## Use Public or Protected to Access Data?
- If we wanted the ability to alter the Shape's variable color from outside the Shape class code, we could set the String variable color to be public or protected
- However, it is recommended that class variables are declared as private
```java
public class Shape {
	protected String color;
}// end class shape
```

```java
public class Shape {
	public String color;
}// end class shape
```
## Changing the Color
- If the variable is declared as public, code that extends or creates a Shape object could change the color without using an accessor method like setColor()
```java
/*example for extending the shapr class, then changing the color*/
super.color = "Blue";

/*example for creating a Shape object and changing the color*/
Shape s1 = new Shape();
s1.color = "Blue";
```

# Member Access and Inheritance
- How do these access modifiers affect inheritance?
- With encapsulation, even subclasses cannot access private methods and variables
- public and protected modifiers provide access to superclass methods and variables

| **Access Modifier** | **Accessed by:**                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `public`            | All classes                                                                              |
| `private`           | Only the class itself                                                                    |
| `protected`         | All subclasses and all classes in the same package                                       |
| "default"           | If no keyword is specified, member variables can be accessed by any class in the package |
## Extending the Shape Class
- Since Shape is not a specific class, we can extend it by creating more specific classes, such as, Rectangle and Square
- We will begin by creating a Rectangle class that extends the Shape class
## Inheriting Constructors
- Although a subclass inherits all of the methods and fields from a parent class, it does not inherit constructors
- You can:
	- Write your own constructor or constructors
	- Use the default constructor
		- If you do not declare a constructor, a default no-argument constructor is provided for you
		- If you declare your own constructor, the default constructor is no longer provided
### Using the Keyword Super in a Constructor
- When creating a Rectangle object, you will need to set the color of the Rectangle
- If the variable color is private in the Shape superclass, how do you set it?
- To construct an instance of a subclass, it is often easiest to call the constructor of the parent class
- The `super` keyword is used to call a parent's constructor
- It must be the first statement of the constructor
- If it is not provided, a default call to super() is implicitly inserted for you
- The `super` keyword may also be used to invoke a parent's method or to access a parent's (non-private) field
```java
public class Rectangle extends Shape {
	private int length;
	private int width;

	//constructor
	public Rectangle(String color, int length, int width) {
		super(color);
		this.length = length;
		this.width = width;
	}// end constructor
}//end class Rectangle
```
### Adding Methods for the Rectangle Class
- Rectangle methods that would be useful include:
```java
public int getWidth() {
	return width;
}//end method getWidth

public void setWidth(int width) {
	this.width = width;
}//end methods setWidth

public int getLength() {
	return length;
}//end method getLength

public void setLength(int length) {
	this.length = length;
}//end method setLength

public int getArea() {
	return length * width;
}//end method getArea
```
### Rectangle Class Methods
- Since Square is a type of Rectangle, or extends the Rectangle class, it will inherit all of the methods from the Rectangle superclass:
```java
public int getWidth()
public void setWidth(int width)
public int getLength()
public void setLength(int length)
public int getArea()
```
### Set Up the Class
- This code sets up the class
- Use the keyword `extends` to inherit the methods from Rectangle
```java
public class Square extends Rectangle {
	
}//end class Square
```
### Write the Constructor
- To write the constructor, consider what values need to be initialized
- If we use the Rectangle super constructor, we need to pass it the values: String color, int length, and int width
- Our Square constructor requires these as parameters if we want to call the super constructor
```java
public class Square extends Rectangle {
	public Square(String color, int length, int width) {
	
	}//end constructor
}//end class Square
```
- Aren't length and width equal for a square?
### Size Parameter
- Although Squares are a type of Rectangle, they have a unique property such that length = width
- Accommodate this by only requiring one size parameter that sets both the width and length values
```java
public class Square extends Rectangle {
	public Square(String color, int size) {
		super(color, size, size);
	}//end constructor
}//end class Square
```
### Unique Variables for the Subclass
- What about unique variables that apply only to Squares and not Rectangles?
- For example, a feature that tells us whether or not to fill in a Square
- Add a boolean value in the parameters list to add this unique variable for the Square class:
```java
public class Square extends Rectangle {
	private boolean isFilled;
	public Square(String color, int size, boolean isFilled) {
		super(color, size, size);
		this.isFilled = isFilled;
	}//end constructor
}//end class Square
```
### Customize Methods
- Because a Square has the same values for length and width, we want to customize the methods setWidth(int width) and setLength(int length) so that both are updated when the method is called
- Use the keyword `super` to call the superclass's methods setLength() and setWidth() and set them both to the parameter value passed to the method
```java
public void setWidth(int width) {
	super.setLength(width);
	super.setWidth(width);
}//end method setWidth
```
### Square Subclass
- The final product will look like the following:
```java
public class Square extends Rectangle {
	private boolean isFilled;

	public Square(String color, int size, boolean isFilled) {
		super(color, size, size);
		this.isFilled = isFilled;
	}//end constructor

	public void setLength(int length) {
		super.setLength(length);
		super.setWidth(length);
	}//end method setLength
	public void setWidth(int width) {
		super.setLength(width);
		super.setWidth(width);
	}//end method setWidth
	public boolean getIsFilled() {
		return isFilled;
	}//end method getIsFilled
}//end class Square
```
## Rectangle Subclass
- The final product will look like the following:
```java
public class Rectangle extends Shape {
	private int length;
	private int width;

	//constructor
	public Rectangle(String color, int length, int width) {
		super(color);
		this.length = legnth;
		this.width = width;
	}//end constructor

	public int getWidth() {
		return width;
	}//end method getWidth
	public void setWidth(int width) {
		this.width = width;
	}//end method setWidth
	public int getLength() {
		return length;
	}//end method getLength
	public void setLength(int length) {
		this.length = length;
	}//end method setLength
	public int getArea() {
		return length * width;
	}//end method getArea
}//end class Rectangle
```

# Shape Class
```java
public class Shape {
	private String color; //the color of the Shape

	public Shape(String color) {
		this.color = color;
	}//end constructor method

	//Method which returns the color
	public String getColor() {
		return color;
	}//end method getColor

	public void setColor(String color) {
		this.color = color;
	}//end method setColor
}//end class Shape
```

# Test Class
```java
package shapes;

import java.awt.Color;

public class ShapeDriver {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Square sq1 = new Square("Black", 5, true);
		Rectangle rec1 = new Rectangle("Red", 5, 3);
		
		System.out.println("The area of the rectangle is: " + rec1.getArea());
		System.out.println("The area of the square is: " + sq1.getArea());
		System.out.println("The square is " + sq1.getIsFilled()?"filled":"not filled"));
	}//end method main
}//end class ShapeDriver
```

# Inheritance and Applets
- Java applets are another example of using inheritance
- A Java applet is a web-based Java program that can be embedded into a web browser
- The class Applet can be extended to create special applets using some of the core methods in the Applet class
## Java Documentation for Applet Class
- Visit the Java Documentation for the Applet class to learn more
- For all documentation, visit:
> http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/
- For just the class Applet's documentation, visit:
>http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/applet/Applet.html
## Creating Applets
- To create an applet, you can borrow all of the core methods in the Applet class and customize these methods to suit the particular needs of you applet
- For example, to make an applet that draws Shapes, start by setting up the inheritance with extends:
```java
public class DrawShapes extends Applet {
	...
}//end class DrawShapes
```
- Now our applet class DrawShapes will inherit methods from Applet that we can customize to build the applet
## Applet Example
```java
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.Graphics;
import java.awt.Graphis2D;
import java.awt.Rectangle;

public class RectangleApplet extends Applet {
	public void paint(Graphics g) {
		Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D)g;
		Rectangle testRectangle = new Rectangle(5, 10, 20, 30);
		g2.draw(testRectangle);
	}//end method paint
}//end class RectangleApplet
```
