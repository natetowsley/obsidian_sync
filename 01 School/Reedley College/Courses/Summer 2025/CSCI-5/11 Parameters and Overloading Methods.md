# Access Modifiers
- Access modifiers specify accessibility to changing variables, methods, and classes
- There are four access modifiers in Java:

| **Access Modifier**             | **Description**                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| public                          | Allows access from anywhere                                                                                               |
| protected                       | Allows access only from inside the same class, from a subclass, or from other classes of the same package as the modifier |
| private                         | Allows access only from inside the same class as the modifier                                                             |
| "default" (not specified/blank) | Allows access from only inside the same class, or from other classes of the same package as the modifier                  |
## public Access Modifier
- public access modifiers allow access from anywhere
- In Java, adding the keyword public as the variable, method, or class is declared, makes the variable, method, or class accessible from anywhere
### Declaring as public
- The code below shows how to declare a variable, method, or class as public
- Variable:
```java
public int milesRan = 2; //public access
int timePassed = 17; //access not specified
```
- Method:
```java
public int addMiles(int a, int b) {
	return a + b;
} //end method addMiles
```
- Class:
```java
public class Jogging {
	//class code here
} //end class Jogging
```
## protected and "default" Access Modifiers
- A protected access modifier allows access inside the class, subclass, or other classes of the same package as the modifier
- To declare a variable, method, or class as protected, write the keyword protected rather than public
- A "default" access modifier allows access from inside the same package only
- To declare a variable, method, or class as "default", do not include an access modifier
## private Access Modifier
- A private access modifier:
	- Only allows access from inside the same class
	- Is the only restrictive access modifier
	- Is the opposite of the public access modifier
```java
private int bankAccountNumber;
```

# When to Use public or private

| **Type** | **Definition**                                | **When to Use**                                                                                                |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| public   | Allows access from anywhere                   | When it does not matter that anyone can access your code or when you wish to share your code with others       |
| private  | Allows access only from inside the same class | When it is important that your code is secure and cannot be accessed from anywhere but inside the class itself |

# Objects as Parmeters
- A parameter is a variable in a method declaration that is passed to the method
```java
public int method(int parameter1, int parameter2) {}
```
- Parameter types are the type of parameters that can be passed to a method
- This includes:
	- Primitive types(int, double, char)
	- Objects
		- String
		- Array
```java
public int method(int anInt, double aDouble, String aString, MyClassName anObjectOfMyClass) {}
```
## Example
- An employer has an opening for a promotion of one of his employees
- He wishes to create a method that will take in an employee as a parameter and calculate and return the employee's rating based on their qualifications for the new position
```java
public int promotion(Employee E) {
	int timeEmployed = E.getLengthOfEmployment();
	// do some calcualtions to set the rating for employee E
	return rating;
} //end method promotion
```
## Passing Objects as Parameters
- Passing objects as parameters allows for much easier access to the information that the object contains
- It also permits making changes to objects inside of the method, and even allows for comparing two objects that cannot use primitive comparing methods
## Returning Objects
- Writing a method that returns an object is very similar to writing a method that returns a primitive data type
- For example, the employer from the previous example just learned that methods can return an object
	- To make it easier to find the employee to promote, he can write a method that takes in two employees
	- This method can return the employee that has a better rating
	- This is easier than going through each employee, retrieving each of their ratings, and then comparing them
```java
public Employee promotion(Employee A, Employee B) {
	//calculate to compare which employee is better

	//if employee A is better
	return A;
	//if employee B is better
	return B;
} //end method promotion
```

# Variable Argument Methods
- A variable argument method:
	- Is a method written to handle a variable number of arguments
	- Only works if you call the method with the same type of argument as the method requires
- A variable argument method could look like this:
```java
public int total(int ... nums) {
	int sum = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
		sum += nums[i];
	}
	return sum;
} //end method total
```
- A method initialized with a variable argument of integers cannot be called with any number of Strings, but can only be called with any number of integers for the argument
- If another method is declared with a variable argument of Strings, they must call that method with String(s) to meet the arguments
## Why not use Arrays in Variable Argument Methods?
- Why not just use an array?
	- In a program, you must know the number of elements in an array to create one
	- If the number of elements changes, you would need a different array for each different length
	- Using a variable argument method allows for use of the method without ever having to initialize an array
	- It also allows for multiple uses with a variable number of elements
## Variable Argument Methods and Integers
- Does a variable argument method only work with integers?
	- No, the variable argument works with any primitive type, object, and even arrays
	- You can have a variable argument of arrays
### Employee Example
- To determine employee promotions, the employer was coding a method that compared two employees and returned the best one
	- Now that the employer has the method to compare the employees, he needs a way to compare all the employees at once instead of only comparing two at a time
	- This is where variable arguments would help
```java
public Employee promotion(Employee ... employees) {
	Employee bestCandidate = employees[0];
	/*go through the list of employees and calculate
	which one is the best candidate*/
	for(int i = 1; i < employees.length; i++) {
		if(employees[i].getRating > bestCandidate.getRating) {
			bestCandidate = employees[i];
		}
	}
	return bestCandidate
}
```
## Calling a Method with Variable Arguments
- Calling a method with variable arguments is like calling any other method
- However, it can be called with a different number of arguments each time it is called
```java
Employee newManager = promotion(sam, erica, dominic);

Employee newAssistantManager = promotion(sandy, jake);
```

# Overloading Constructors
- Constructors assign initial values to instance variables of a class
- Constructors inside a class are declared like methods
- Overloading a constructor means having more than one constructor with the same name but different types and/ or numbers of arguments
## Example
```java
public class Dog{
	public Dog() {
		//implementation
	} // end constructor
	public Dog(int weight) {
		//implementation
	} // end constructor
	public Dog(String barkNoise) {
		//implementation
	} // end constructor
	public Dog(int weight, int loudness, String barkNoise) {
		//implementation
	} // end constructor
} //end class dog
```

## How Overloading Constructors Works
- Overloading constructors works as follows:
	- Java reads the constructor based on what arguments are passed into it
	- Once it identifies the constructor name, it will compare the argument types
	- If the argument types do not match the first constructor of that name, it will proceed to the second, third, and so on until it identifies a constructor name and argument type match
	- If it does not find a match, then the program will not compile
## Example 2
```java
public class Dog {
	private int weight;
	private int loudness;
	private String barkNoise;

	public Dog() {
		weight = 12;
		loudness = 4;
		barkNoise = "Woof";
	}

	public Dog(int w, int l) {
		weight = w;
		loudness = l;
		barkNoise = "ARF!";
	}

	public Dog(int w, int l, String bark) {
		weight = w;
		loudness = l;
		barkNoise = bark;
	}
}
```
- Dog() is the default constructor
- A default constructor has no arguments
- If you initialized a Dog object using this constructor, it would have a weight of 12, a loudness of 4, and a bark noise of "woof"
- The last two constructors in the Dog class allow the assignment of instance variables to differ according to specifications during initialization
- Although the default Dog constructor has code to initialize the class variables, it is optional for a default constructor to have code
- **If the default constructor does not have code, the class variables are initialized with:**
	- null for objects
	- 0 (zero) for primitive numeric types
	- false for boolean
- If a constructor is not written for a class, the default constructor (with no code) is supplied by the JVM
- If there is not a default constructor written, and there are one or more other constructors, the JVM will not supply a default constructor

# Overloading Methods
- Like overloading constructors, overloading a method occurs when the type and/or number of parameters differ
	- Below is an example of a situation where a method would need to be overloaded
		- Create the Dog class, then create an instance of Dog in a Driver Class
		- Call (use) bot bark() methods
```java
public class Dog{
	private int weight;
	private int loudness;
	private String barkNoise;
	public void bark(String b) {
		System.out.println(b);
	}
	public void bark() {
		System.out.println("Woof");
	}
}
```
