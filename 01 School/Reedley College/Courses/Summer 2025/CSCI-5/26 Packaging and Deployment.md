# Define a Package
- A package is a collection of Java classes
- Think of a package as a folder on your hard drive
- To define a package, specify the package name int the first line of a class definition using the keyword package
```java
package graphics; //graphics is the name of our package

//Rectangle is part of the graphics package
class Rectangle {
	/* Class code is placed here */
} //End of class Rectangle
```

# Using Java Files Stored in a Package
- When you want your program to use the Java files that are stored in a package, make sure that the package is listed in the CLASSPATH setting
- This way the files can be found and used
- A class can only be in one package

# Naming a Package
- With programmers worldwide writing classes and interfaces using the Java programming language, it is likely that some will use the same name for different types
- In face, the previous example does just that: It defines a Rectangle class when there is already a Rectangle class in the java.awt package
- Still, the compiler allows both classes to have the same name if they are in different packages
## Fully Qualified Names and Package Names
- The fully qualified name of each Rectangle class includes the package name
- The fully qualified name of the Rectangle class in the graphics package is graphics.Rectangle
- The fully qualified name of the Rectangle class in the java.awt package is java.awt.Rectangle
- This works well unless two independent programmers use the same name for their packages
- However, convention prevents this problem
## Package Naming Conventions
- Package names are written in all lower case to avoid conflict with the names of classes or interfaces
- Companies use their reversed Internet domain name to begin their package names
- For example, com.example.mypackage for a package names mypackage created by a programmer at example.com
- If a programmer at code.org also created a package named mypackage, then the package name would need to be org.code.mypackage to follow the conventions established and to avoid collisions
## Name Collisions
- Name collisions that occur within a single company need to be handled by convention within that company
- For example, include the region or project name after the company name
	- (com.example.region.mypackage)
- Packages in the Java language itself begin with java. or javax
## When Internet Domain Name is Invalid
- In some cases, the internet domain name may not be a valid package name
- This can occur if:
	- The domain name contains a hyphen or other special character
	- The package name begins with a digit or other character that is illegal to use as the beginning of a Java name
	- The package name contains a reserved Java keyword, such as "int"
- When this happens, the suggested convention is to add an underscore
### Legalizing Package Names

| **Domain Name**                 | **Package Name Prefix**       | **Information About Conversion to Package Name**                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| hyphenated-<br>name.example.org | `org.example.hyphenated_name` | The hyphen in the domain name was replaced by an underscore in the package name                       |
| example.int                     | `int_.example`                | The word `int` in the domain name is a keyword so it is followed by an underscore in the package name |
| 123name.example.com             | `com.example._123name`        | The name with the number is prefaced with an underscore in the package name                           |

# How to Use a Package
- To use a public package member from outside its package, you must do one of the following:
	- Refer to the member by its fully qualified name
	- Import the package member
	- Import the member's entire package
## Refer to a Package by Fully Qualified Name
- In the past, you may have imported packages to get certain classes for use in your programs
- You can skip importing and refer to a package by the fully qualified name
- The fully qualified name for the Rectangle class declared in the graphics package in the earlier examples is:
```java
graphics.Rectangle
```
## Refer Without Importing Class or Package
- To refer to it in your program without importing the class or package:
```java
graphics.Rectangle myRect = new graphics.Rectangle();
```
- Qualified names are fine for infrequent use but should only be used when accessing the external class a limited number of times
- When a name is used repetitively, typing becomes tedious and produces difficult code to read
- As an alternative, you can import the member or its package and then use its simple name
## Importing a Package Member
- To import a specific member into the current file, put an import statement at the beginning of the code before any type definitions but after the package statement (if there is one)
- Here is how you would import the Rectangle class from the graphics package created in the previous section
```java
import graphics.Rectangle
```
- Now you can refer to the Rectangle class by its simple name
```java
Rectangle myRectangle = new Rectangle();
```
## Import Entire Package
- If you use many types from a package, you should import the entire package
- To import all the types contained in a particular package, use the import statement with the asterisk wildcard character
```java
import graphics.*;
```
- Now you can refer to any class or interface in the graphics package by its simple name
- The asterisk in the import statement can only be used to specify all the classes within a package
```java
Circle myCircle = new Circle();
Rectangle myRectangle = new Rectangle();
```

# Hierarchies of Packages
- At first, packages appear to be hierarchical, but the are not
- For example that Java API includes a
	- java.awt package
	- java.awt.color package
	- java.awt.font package
	- and many others that begin with java.awt
- The java.awt.color package, the java.awt.font package and the other java.awt.xxxx package are not included when importing the java.awt package
- The prefix java.awt (the Java Abstract Window Toolkit) is used for a number of related packages to make the relationship evident, but not to show inclusion

# Importing Subpackages
- When you import a package, you only get the classes at that package level
- Subpackages are not included and will need to be imported separately
- Unused imported packages just adds unnecessary code to your application
## importing java.awt.*
- Importing java.awt.* imports all of the types in the java.awt package, but it does not import java.awt.color, java.awt.font, or any other java.awt.xxxx packages
- If you plan to use the classes and other types in java.awt.color as well as those in java.awt, you must import both packages with all their files:
```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.color.*;
```

# Deploying an Application
- Eventually you are ready to deploy your application so that users can run it from outside the development environment (IDE)
- There are two types of deployment technologies available in JavaTM 2 Standard Edition (J2SE) for deploying client-side Java applications on the desktop:
	- Java Plug-in
	- Java Web Start
## Java Plug-In
- Java Plug-in:
	- Is a tool used to deploy Java applets that run inside a web browser
	- Uses Web Start to deploy standalone Java applications on the desktop, using JNLP (Java Network Launching Protocol)
- Supported web browsers include:
	- Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Apple Safari and Microsoft Edge all run Java although some will require some modifications to the browser settings
	- Most of the modern browsers have moved away from allowing the running of Java Applets so Oracle recommends Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 that still supports NPAPI plug-ins

# Steps to Deploying an Application (Command Line)
1. Compile your application's Java code and make sure that all class files and resources such as images are in a separate directory
2. Create a JAR file containing your application's class files and resources by running appropriate command line commands:
```console
% cd path/to/classes
% jar cvf Sample.jar SampleCode
```
3. Create a JNLP file that describes how your application/applet should be launched
4. There are different versions for applets and applications
5. Create the HTML page from which your application/applet will be launched
6. Invoke Deployment Toolkit functions to deploy the Java Web Start application/applet
7. Again refer to the site for [[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/|code samples]]
8. Place the application's JAR file, JNLP file, and HTML page in the appropriate folders
9. Open the application's HTML page in a browser to view the application/applet
10. Check the Java Console log for error and debugging messages

# Steps to Deploying an Application (Using the Eclipse IDE)
- Creating a runnable JAR file in Eclipse
- This is a relatively straight forward process
1. Choose File or Right click the project file folder on the project explorer window and choose Export from the menu
2. From the dialog box open the Java option and then choose runnable JAR file from the list
3. Click on the next button
4. On the screen configure the options as you want
	1. Launch Configuration - This is the driver class of your application
	2. Export Destination - Where you want to save the JAR file
	3. Library Handline - Leave this as the default
	4. ANT File allows you to create documentation that will recreate the JAR file for you in the future, save this in your workspace
	5. Go to your save location and double click the JAR file
	6. Your program should run

# Creating a JavaFX JAR File
- Open JavaFX_Tutorial.pdf for instructions to complete the tasks for creating a JavaFX JAR file
- You will require the JavaFX_Graphics.zip file to complete the tutorial
- Complete all the tasks in the tutorial
	- Download and install JavaFX in Eclipse
	- Create a JavaFX application
	- Test the application
	- Create a Runnable JAR file for the application
	- Run the application outside the development environment

# Two Tier and Three Tier Architecture
- Up to this point, you have written programs that are one tier architecture systems
- One tier architecture systems:
	- Run on one computer at a time
	- Are more complex to program as you add layers and functionality
- Functionality types may include:
	- Server and client processes
	- Database storage and retrieval
## Tier Architecture
- The concept of tiers provides a convenient way to group different classes of computer architecture
- If you application is running on a single computer, it has one tier architecture
- If your application is running on two computers, such as a typical web server application that runs on a Web browser (client) and a Web server, then it has two tiers
## Two and Three Tier Systems
- In a two tier system, you have a client program and a server program
- The server responds to requests from many different clients
- The clients usually initiate the requests for information from a single server
- A three tier application adds a third program to the mix, such as a database, in which the server stores its data
### Two Tier Architecture Deployment
- A two tier system usually consists of a client and a server program
- The server program runs on a web server
- The client programs could be applets running via html webpages
- Applets would communicate with the server program to get instructions
### Two Tier Architecture Deployment Example
- An example of two tier architecture is a two player chess game
- Each user would access the client application, but a server application would be needed to handle the communications between the clients and determine game play
- To deploy such a system one would need to set the server application to auto start on the web server and have the Java applet communicate with the server via http protocols
### Three Tier Architecture Deployment Example
- To turn the chess game into a three tier system, we could add a database to store the results of a chess game for later rankings and retrieval of user information
- Java uses JDBC connectivity to communicate with a variety of databases
- To deploy this implementation:
	- A database need to run on a server
	- The Java server application would need to have connectivity using the JDBC driver and appropriate ports to access the database
- Using a database as the main storage for data is now the most common way of storing and retrieving information within applications
- The method of doing this has been greatly simplified over the years and it is now a fairly straightforward procedure to connect you application to a database back end
- This will be explored in more detail in the next section
