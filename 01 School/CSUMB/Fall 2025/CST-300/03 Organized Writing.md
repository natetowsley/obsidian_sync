# Why Organization Matters
- Organization is the backbone of communication
- Different writing types serve distinct purposes and audiences each requiring tailored organizational approaches to maximize clarity and impact

# The Linear Writing Process
- The linear approach represents a traditional, step-by-step method where writers move sequentially through stages without revisiting previous work
- While efficient in theory, this method assumes perfect planning from the outset

## What MEAL Prevents
- **Topic Drift**: Paragraphs that start with one idea but end discussing something else entirely
- **Evidence Dumping**: Including quotes, data, or examples without explaining their significance
- **Weak Connections**: Failing to show how individual paragraphs connect to the overall argument
