# What is Academic Citation
- Giving credit to original authors when using their ideas, words, or data
- Required in academic writing to maintain integrity
- Allows readers to verify and locate your sources
- APA is widely used in the social sciences and technical fields

# Why Use APA?
- Standardized format for citing sources
- Supports academic integrity
- Helps readers locate original sources
- Structures scholarly and technical writing

# Citation vs. Reference
- **Citation:** Brief information in the text (Author, Year) directing readers to the source
- **Reference:** Full source details listed at the end of the document
- Citation points to a reference; the two work together
## In-text, Parenthetical, and Mixed Citations
- **In-text (Narrative):** Author and year within the sentence
	- Ex: Kim (2021) found that debugging is an essential part of development
- **Parenthetical:** Author and year in parentheses at the end of the sentence
	- Ex: Debugging is an essential part of development (Kim, 2021)
- **Mixed:** Combines narrative and parenthetical
	- Ex: Kim (2021) notes that debugging is vital, which supports earlier research (Lee, 2019)

# What is Quoting?
- Using the exact words from a source
- Use quotation marks and include page or paragraph numbers
	- Ex: "Debugging is an essential part of the software development cycle" (Kim, 2021, p. 42)
	- Ex: Kim (2021, p. 42) states, "debugging is an essential part of the software development cycle

# What is Summarizing?
- Condensing the main idea(s) of a longer section of text
- Focus on key points, omit details
	- Ex: Kim (2021) explains that debugging is one of several vital development stages

# What is Paraphrasing?
- Restating an idea in your own words and sentence structure
- Must preserve the original meaning
	- Ex: Identifying and fixing code errors is a critical phase in development (Kim 2021)

# Tips for Accurate Citation
- Cite as you go -- don't wait until the end
- Match every in-text citation with a reference entry
- Double-check spelling of author names and dates
- Include page/para for direct quotes
