# AJAX
- Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
- It also supports JSON and plain text
- It's a client-side technique to submit and get data to/from a web server without reloading the page
- It can be used for creating Single Page Applications
- Common implementations: jQuery, fetch, Axios

# JS Objects
- JS Objects are used to store data in `property:value` pairs
- EX:
```js
const person = {
	firstName: "John",
	lastNmae: "Doe",
	age: 20,
	eyeColor:"blue"
};
```
- To access a value, use:
```js
variable_name.property;

//Example
person.firstName;
```
- JavaScript provides *non-blocking* functionality, allowing code to be executed concurrently (asynchronously)
