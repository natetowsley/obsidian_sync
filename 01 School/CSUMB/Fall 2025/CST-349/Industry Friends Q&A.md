# Questions
## [Angel Bedolla-Alcantar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angel-bedolla223/) 
> SWE @ Uber, Twice SWE Intern @ Uber prior
##### You Interned at Uber twice before eventually getting your return offer, what actions did you take the first time around that led to you returning for that second internship?


##### Was there ever a point within your internships where a completely new technology was thrown at you? How did you go about researching/ was anyone there to sort of coach you up on it?


## [Laura McRae](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mcraeklaura/) 
>Senior SWE @ Airspace
##### How did you bounce back from the unfortunate layoff at CZI? Did you find the process harder or easier than landing your first job after graduating?


##### As a senior engineer, what skills do you see emerging in recent months/years as more valuable for an engineer than most would assume?


## [Nicholas Anderson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-anderson-b4783b205/)
> SWE @ Vault JS
##### When you stepped on at Vault as an intern, what were some of the tasks like? Was a lot of stuff sort of sent down the ladder to you or did you find yourself specifically being assigned responsibilities directly?


## [Dante Moon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dantemoon/)
>Data Science @ Optum
##### I noticed you took on both Data Science and Software Engineering internships, can I ask was that a shift in career desires, or just a result of mass applying, and if so would you recommend applying for roles even slightly out of one's career vision?


##### When you landed that first internship, what do you think held the most weight both on the resume, and in the interview?


## [Derek Lilienthal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/derek-lilienthal/)
>AI SWE @ Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
##### You've gone through so much schooling in relation to computer science. What do you see as some of the most valuable lessons that you've learned maybe not in class specifically, but about the process of learning something as a whole? (strategies/ best practices)


## [Sean McCarthy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mccarthy-sean-m/)
>Senior SWE @ Salesforce
##### First of all I'm also from Kingsburg so go Vikings, secondly I wanted to ask about your time interning at Salesforce. With those whom you made connections with, what was the relationship like after the internship? Did you stay in touch often, or what did it look like?


## [Maritza Azbun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maritza-abzun-8912aaa7/)
>VP, Senior Lead SWE @ JPMorgan
##### I saw that at your time at CSUMB, you were a "Peer Leader", could I ask how that came about? Was that something organized by the school or did you just make it happen on your own accord?


## [Erik Burgess](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikburgess/)
>SWE @ Walmart
##### You've been in the industry for some time now, what skills and traits do you see being the most consistent in yourself and your peers even with so much change constantly happening in the industry?


## [Lucas Childers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucaschilders/)
>Lead SWE @ Salesforce
##### I saw that you developed an application using Salesforce for students at CSUMB. Do you think that proactivity helped your case for eventually joining Salesforce full time?


## [Diego Vega Maravilla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-vega-swe/)
> Senior SWE @ Intuit
##### I was looking at your LinkedIn page and couldn't find any internships so I wanted to ask if that was the case, and if so how the job search period looked for you because I find that to be a valuable perspective. What did you do to stick out?
