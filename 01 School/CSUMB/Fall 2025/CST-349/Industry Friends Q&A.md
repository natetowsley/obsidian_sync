> SWE @ Uber, Twice SWE Intern @ Uber prior
##### You Interned at Uber twice before eventually getting your return offer, what actions did you take the first time around that led to you returning for that second internship?


##### Was there ever a point within your internships where a completely new technology was thrown at you? How did you go about researching/ was anyone there to sort of coach you up on it?


## [Laura McRae](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mcraeklaura/) 
>Senior SWE @ Airspace
##### How did you bounce back from the unfortunate layoff at CZI? Did you find the process harder or easier than landing your first job after graduating?


##### As a senior engineer, what skills do you see emerging in recent months/years as more valuable for an engineer than most would assume?


## [Nicholas Anderson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-anderson-b4783b205/)
> SWE @ Vault JS
##### When you stepped on at Vault as an intern, what were some of the tasks like? Was a lot of stuff sort of sent down the ladder to you or did you find yourself specifically being assigned responsibilities directly? 
- Felt that he got the grunt work sent down to him as the intern
	- That work solidified a good foundation for him within the company
- Some of these mundane or tedious tasks end up being the most important


##### How has your startup (Vault JS) moved forward with AI as it grows in popularity?
- It's expected at this point that your product integrates AI
	- While helpful, must be cautious about "tech debt"
- Automated predictions
- They have their own in house LLM that they are developing
- Often used for unit tests, formatting boilerplate code
- Important to struggle as a student, avoid AI use so you can learn


##### How was the turnover from intern to full time staff when you got a return offer?
- Doing well on the mundane open doors to the more "fun" tasks

## [Dante Moon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dantemoon/)
>Data Science @ Optum
##### I noticed you took on both Data Science and Software Engineering internships, can I ask was that a shift in career desires, or just a result of mass applying, and if so would you recommend applying for roles even slightly out of one's career vision?


##### When you landed that first internship, what do you think held the most weight both on the resume, and in the interview?


## [Derek Lilienthal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/derek-lilienthal/)
>AI SWE @ Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
##### You've gone through so much schooling in relation to computer science. What do you see as some of the most valuable lessons that you've learned maybe not in class specifically, but about the process of learning something as a whole? (strategies/ best practices)
- Some things you just don't learn in school that apply to the job itself (SWE)
	- High level discussion
	- Groups/planning
- Hard Skills:
	- Never learned how to use cloud before where he is now
- LinkedIn Learning
- Interactive courses
	- Hands on learning
	- More benefit that a video tutorial

##### How has your undergrad curriculum affected your approach to grad school research?
- Undergrad you learn the basics of whatever topic you're studying
	- Application is what you do after getting the degree
- Lots of relearning and relearning deeper than before
###### FOLLOW UP: How do you stay motivated to keep learning all these skills?
- It's hard, very hard
	- Some topics are boring, unimportant, unused in certain jobs
- The motivation is always what do you want to get out of it
	- Higher education, job, etc.
- It does get better!!

##### Did you do any internships during your undergrad?
- No, no industry internships
- Did some research with faculty
- Didn't get first internship until after bachelor's
###### FOLLOW UP: Would you say research or internships were more valuable or are they equally contributing?
- Prior research is pretty much a necessity for pursuing a PhD
	- Whether that be during undergrad or grad school
- Getting that first bit of internship experience gets you a lot further as far as getting a job that research does

	- Can't ship code without 80%


##### How do you get some engineer's out of their shell, get them to be motivated to work in a team?

###### MCP: Model Context Protocol (READ UP)
- Understand what company's are using AI tools for
- Learn about concepts with AI, don't side step any part of the process
