# Web and HTTP
- Web Page consists of objects
	- Can be HTML file, JPEG image, Java applet, audio file, ...
- Web page consists of base HTML file which includes several referenced objects
	- each object is addressable by a URL, ex:

# HTTP Overview
- HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol
- Web's application layer protocol
- Client/Server model
	- **Client**: Browser that requests, receives (using HTTP protocol) and "displays" Web objects
	- **Server**: Web server sends (using HTTP protocol) objects in response to requests
- Client initiates a connection (creates socket) to server
- Server accepts the connection from client
- HTTP messages (application-layer protocol messages) exchanged between browser (HTTP client) and Web server (HTTP server)
- Connection closed

## HTTP Connections
- Non-persistent HTTP:
	- At most one object sent over connection
		- Connection then closes
	- Downloading multiple objects required multiple connections
- Persistent HTTP
	- Multiple objects can be sent over single connection between client and server

### Non-Persistent HTTP
- Advantages of Non-Persistent Connection
	- Not wasting resource because the connection opens only when there is some data to be sent
	- More secure because after sending that data, the connection gets terminated and nothing can be shared thereafter
- Disadvantages of Non-Persistent Connection
	- Requires a greater CPU overhead for the transmission of data
![[Pasted image 20260211151421.png|300]]
### Persistent HTTP
- Advantages of Persistent Connection
	- Lower CPU and memory usage because there is less number of connections
	- Reduced network congestion (fewer connections)
	- Reduced latency in subsequent requests (do not have to re-establish connections)
- Disadvantages of Persistent Connection
	- Resources may be kept occupied even when not needed and may not be available to others
	- Security issues
- Most modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, ...) use persistent connections
- When loading a website, web clients open connections to the same site
	- Most of the contents often come with from the same web site, and significant number of hyperlinks to other objects often point to the same site
- An application that initiates an HTTP request to a server likely will make more requests to that server in the near future (to fetch the inline images, for example)
	- This property is called site locality
![[Pasted image 20260211151447.png|300]]
- The ***"pipelining*** feature in HTTP/1.1 allows requests to be issued asynchronously on a persistent connection
- Requests must be processed in proper order
	- Can do clever packaging
## Some Problems with Pipelining
- The server must send its responses in the same order that the requests were received
	- The entire connection remains first-in-first-out basis
- Head-of-line-blocking (HOL Blocking)
	- A performance-limiting phenomenon that occurs when a line of packets is held up by the first packet
- Most browsers disabled this feature by default
## Concurrent Persistent Connections
- The only way possible to achieve concurrent requests is by making use of multiple persistent connections
- Why limit the number of concurrent connections?
	- Too many connections imply a lot of burden for the server
	- Denial of Service (DoS) attack

# HTTP Request Message
- Two types of HTTP messages: ***request, response***
- HTTP request message in ASCII (human-readable format)
![[Pasted image 20260211152045.png|500]]
## General Format
### Request Line

### Header Lines

# Uploading Form Input
- POST method:
	- Web page often includes form input
	- Input is uploaded to the server in entity body
- URL method:
	- Uses GET method
	- Input is uploaded in URL field of request line:
		- EX: `www.somesite.com/animalsearch?elephant&apple`
## Example: Login Form
```http
<form method=“POST” action=“login.php”>
	Username:
	<input type=“text” name=“username”/>
	Password:
	<input type=“password” name=“password”/>
	<input type=“submit”/>
</form>
```
- The browser will generate a "POST" request, as instructed by the programmer
## HTTP POST Request
```http
POST /login.php HTTP/1.1
Host: in.gr
Proxy-Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 31
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Accept:
text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,
*/*;q=0.8
Origin: null
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64)
AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/38.0.2125.104
Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8
username=admin&password=letmein
```
### At Server-Side
- When receives the request, the webserver will pass it to a web application to check if the user exists
	- Could be in a database (on the same machine or on other dedicated servers)
- Assume that the username and password are correct
	- The server will respond with the proper page to the user

# Method Types
>***HTTP/1.0:***
- GET
	- Requests data (a representation) of the specified resource
	- Requests using GET should only retrieve data, it should not include data in body
- HEAD
	- Asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without the response body
	- EX: If a URL might produce a large download, a HEAD request could read its Content-Length header to check the file size without actually downloading
- POST
	- Submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server

>***HTTP/1.1:***
- GET, HEAD, POST
- PUT
	- Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload
	- Uploads file in entity body to path specified in URL field
	- Compared to POST method, PUT requests are idempotent: calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times
- DELETE
	- Deletes file specified in the URL field

# HTTP Response Message
![[Pasted image 20260211153713.png|600]]
## Response Status Codes
- Status code appears in 1st line in server-to-client response message
- Important response codes:
	- **2XX**: Success
		- ex: `200 OK` -> Request succeeded, requested object later in this message
	- **3XX**: Redirection
		- ex: `301 Moved Permanently` -> Requested object moved, new location specified later in this message (location)
	- **4XX**: Client-Side Error
		- ex: `404 Not Found` -> requested document not found on this server
	- **5XX**: Server-Side Error
		- ex: `500 Internal Server Error`
		- `505 HTTP Version Not Supported`
