# Web and HTTP
- Web Page consists of objects
	- Can be HTML file, JPEG image, Java applet, audio file, ...
- Web page consists of base HTML file which includes several referenced objects
	- each object is addressable by a URL, ex:

# HTTP Overview
- HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol
- Web's application layer protocol
- Client/Server model
	- **Client**: Browser that requests, receives (using HTTP protocol) and "displays" Web objects
	- **Server**: Web server sends (using HTTP protocol) objects in response to requests
- Client initiates a connection (creates socket) to server
- Server accepts the connection from client
- HTTP messages (application-layer protocol messages) exchanged between browser (HTTP client) and Web server (HTTP server)
- Connection closed

## HTTP Connections
- Non-persistent HTTP:
	- At most one object sent over connection
		- Connection then closes
	- Downloading multiple objects required multiple connections
- Persistent HTTP
	- Multiple objects can be sent over single connection between client and server
### Non-Persistent HTTP
- Advantages of Non-Persistent Connection
	- Not wasting resource because the connection opens only when there is some data to be sent
	- More secure because after sending that data, the connection gets terminated and nothing can be shared thereafter
- Disadvantages of Non-Persistent Connection
	- Requires a greater CPU overhead for the transmission of data
### Persistent HTTP
- Advantages of Persistent Connection
	- Lower CPU and memory usage because there is less number of connections
	- Reduced network congestion (fewer connections)
	- Reduced latency in subsequent requests (do not have to re-establish connections)
- Disadvantages of Persistent Connection
	- Resources may be kept occupied even when not needed and may not be available to others
	- Security issues
- Most modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, ...) use persistent connections
- When loading a website, web clients open connections to the same site
	- Most of the contents often come with from the same web site, and significant number of hyperlinks to other objects often point to the same site
- An application that initiates an HTTP request to a server likely will make more requests to that server in the near future (to fetch the inline images, for example)
	- This property is called site locality
