# Network Security
- Field of network security:
	- How bad guys can attack computer networks
	- How we can defend networks against attacks
	- How to design architectures that are immune to attacks
- Internet not originally designed with (much) security in mind
	- *original version:* "a group of mutually trusting users attached to a transparent network"
	- Internet protocol designers playing "catch-up"
	- Security considerations in all layers!

# Bad Guys
## Put Malware into Hoses via Internet
- Malware can get in host from:
	- **virus**: Self-replicating infection by receiving/ executing object (e.g., e-mail attachment)
	- **worm**: Self-replicating infection by passively receiving object that gets itself executed
- **Spyware malware** can record keystrokes, web sites visited, upload info to collection site
- Infected host can be enrolled in **botnet**, used for spam (DDoS attacks)
## Attack Server, Network Infrastructure
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Attackers make resources (server, bandwidth) unavailable to legitimate traffic by overwhelming resource with bogus traffic
	1. Select target
	2. Break into hosts around the network (botnet)
	3. Send packets to target from compromised hosts

## Bad Guys can Sniff Packets
- Packet "sniffing":
	- Broadcast media (shared Ethernet, wireless)
	- Promiscuous network interface reads/records all packets (e.g., including passwords) passing by

- Wireshark software labs is a (free) packet-sniffer
## Bad Guys can use Fake Addresses
- **IP Spoofing**: Send packet with false source address
