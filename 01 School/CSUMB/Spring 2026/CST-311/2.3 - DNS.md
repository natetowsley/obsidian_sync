# What is DNS?
- ***Domain Name System*** is the **phone book** of the Internet
	- Matching a domain name to a unique IP address, so we do not have to remember the IP addresses for all online information resources
- EX: csumb.edu -> `15.197.156.176`

## History
- Before DNS, all mappings were in `hosts.txt`
	- `/etc/hosts` on Linux
	- `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows
- Centralized, manual system
	- Changes were submitted to SRI via email
	- Machines periodically FTP new copies of `hosts.txt`
	- Administrators could pick names at their discretion
	- Any name was allowed
		- `tbs_server_at_csumb_pwns_joo_lol_kthxbye`
## Towards DNS
- Eventually, the `hosts.txt` system fell apart
	- Not scalable
	- Hard to enforce uniqueness of names
		- e.g. MIT
			- Massachusetts Institute of Technology?
			- Melbourne Institute of Technology?
	- Many machines had inaccurate copies of `hosts.txt`
- Thus, DNS was born

# How Does DNS Work?

## HOSTS File
- `/etc/hosts` file

## DNS at a High-Level
- Distribute database
	- No centralization
- Simple client/server architecture
	- UDP port 53, some implementation also use TCP
- **Hierarchical** namespace
	- As opposed to original, flat namespace
	- e.g. .com -> google.com -> mail.google.com
### DNS: A Distributed, Hierarchical Database
![[Pasted image 20260216144552.png|450]]
### Why not Centralize DNS?
- Single point of failure
- Traffic volume
- Distant centralized database
- Maintenance
- **Doesn't Scale**
### Root DNS Servers
![[Pasted image 20260216144836.png|350]]
- Contacted by local name server that can not resolve name
- Root name server
	- Contacts authoritative name server if name mapping not known
	- Gets mapping
	- Returns mapping to local name server

### Top-Level Domain (TLD) Servers:
![[Pasted image 20260216144913.png|350]]
- Responsible for com, org, net, edu, aero, jobs, museums, and all top-level country domains, e.g.: uk, fr, ca, jp
	- Network Solutions maintains servers for .com TLD
	- Educase for .edu TLD
### Authoritative DNS Servers
![[Pasted image 20260216145052.png|350]]
- Organization's own DNS server(s), providing authoritative hostname to IP mappings for organization's named hosts
- Can be maintained by organization or service provider
- When a domain is registered, the domain owner specifies the authoritative DNS servers responsible for managing the domain's DNS records
## Local DNS Name Server
- Does not strictly belong to hierarchy
- Each ISP (residential ISP, company, university) has one
	- also called "default name server"
- When host makes DNS query, query is sent to its local DNS server
	- Has local cache of recent name-to-address translation pairs (but may be out of date)
	- Acts as proxy, forwards query into hierarchy
