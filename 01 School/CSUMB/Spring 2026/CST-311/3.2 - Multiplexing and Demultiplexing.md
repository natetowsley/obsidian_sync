# Multiplexing/Demultiplexing
![[Pasted image 20260223154142.png|450]]
- Multiplexing as sender
	- Handle data from multiple sockets, add transport header (later used for demultiplexing)
- Demultiplexing as Receiver
	- Use header info to deliver received segments to correct socket

# How Demultiplexing Works
- Host receives IP datagrams
	- Each datagram has source IP address, destination IP address
	- Each datagram carries on transport-layer segment
- Each segment has source, destination port number
- Host uses IP addresses & port numbers to direct segment to appropriate socket

## Ports
- Ports are virtual endpoints for sending and receiving data on a networked device
- **Port Numbers**: Ports are identified by port numbers ranging from 0 to 65535
	- 16-bit unsigned integers
	- Not all used everyday
- Well-known ports (0-1023): Reserved for specific, widely-used services and protocols
	- EX: port 80: HTTP, port 53: DNS, port 22: SSH
## Finding Port Number Capacity
- The max ports that a number of bits can hold is $2^n$ ports ranging from $[0 \text{ - } (2^n-1)]$ 
## Connectionless Demultiplexing (UDP)
- When creating datagram to send into UDP socket, must specify
	- Destination IP address
	- Destination port number
- When receiving host receives UDP segment:
	- Checks destination port # in segment
	- Directs UDP segment to socket with that port # 
- IP/UDP datagrams with the same dest. port #, but different source IP addresses and/or source port numbers will be directed to the same socket at the receiving host
	- Demultiplexing using destination port number only
	- Destination IP, source IP, and source port does not matter in the demultiplexing process

## Connection-Oriented Demultiplexing (TCP)
- TCP socket identified by 4-tuple
	- Source IP address
	- Source port number
	- Dest IP address
	- Dest port number
- Demux: receiver uses all four values (4-tuple) to direct segment to appropriate socket
- Server may support many simultaneous TCP sockets:
	- Each socket identified by its own 4-tuple
	- Each socket associated with a different connecting client
### Example

## Can Multiple Applications Work on Same Port Number?
- Each browser on a computer uses a unique process, or program, to run
- These processes are separate from one another and each can use the same port number, such as port 80 for web browsing
- When a request is made to that port, the operating system routes the packet to the appropriate browser process based on the address or URL being accessed

# Summary
- Multiplexing, Demultiplexing processes
- **UDP**: Demultiplexing using destination port number (only)
- **TCP**: Demultiplexing using 4-tuple: source and destination IP addresses, and port numbers
- Multiplexing/demultiplexing happens at all layers
