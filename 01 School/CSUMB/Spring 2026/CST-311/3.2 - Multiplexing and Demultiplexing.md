# Multiplexing/Demultiplexing
![[Pasted image 20260223154142.png|450]]
- Multiplexing as sender
	- Handle data from multiple sockets, add transport header (later used for demultiplexing)
- Demultiplexing as Receiver
	- Use header info to deliver received segments to correct socket

# How Demultiplexing Works
- Host receives IP datagrams
	- Each datagram has source IP address, destination IP address
	- Each datagram carries on transport-layer segment
- Each segment has source, destination port number
- Host uses IP addresses & port numbers to direct segment to appropriate socket

## Ports
- Ports are virtual endpoints for sending and receiving data on a networked device
- **Port Numbers**: Ports are identified by port numbers ranging from 0 to 65535
	- 16-bit unsigned integers
	- Not all used everyday
- Well-known ports (0-1023): Reserved for specific, widely-used services and protocols
	- EX: port 80: HTTP, port 53: DNS, port 22: SSH
## Connectionless Demultiplexing (UDP)
- When creating datagram to send into UDP socket, must specify
	- Destination IP address
	- Destination port number
