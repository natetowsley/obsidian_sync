# Review: Internet Protocol Stack
- Internet protocol stack
	- Application Layer
		- Message
	- Transport Layer
		- Segment
	- Network Layer
		- Datagram
	- Datalink Layer
		- Frame
	- Physical Layer
		- Bit
- ISO/OSI protocol stack
	- Application layer
	- Presentation layer
	- Session layer
	- Transport layer
	- Network layer
	- Datalink layer
	- Physical layer
## Some Network Apps
- E-mail
- web
- text messaging
- remote login
- P2P file sharing
- multi-user network games
- streaming stored video (Youtube, Netflix, Hulu)
- Voice Over IP (ex: Skype)
- real-time video conferencing
- social networking
- search
## Creating a Network App
- Write programs that:
	- run on (different) end systems
	- communicate over network
	- ex: web server software communicates with browser software
	- applications on end systems allows for rapid app development, propagation
	- no need to write software for network-core devices

# Review: Architectures
### Client-Server

### Peer-to-Peer (P2P)

## Socket
- Process sends/ receives messages to/from its socket
- Socket analogous to door
	- sending process shoves message out door
	- sending process relies on transport infrastructure on other side of door to deliver message to socket at receiving process

- Socket allows transmission of data between two processes on the same machine or different machines over a network
- Commonly used in client-server interaction, as it allows applications to communicate using the build-in mechanisms of the hardware and operating system
	- The client acts as the requester, where it requests some data
	- The server acts as the listener and provides the client the requested data as the response
### Socket Programming
- Socket programming shows how to use socket application program interfaces (APIs) to establish communication links between remote and local processes
- Many APIs are available for most programming languages
## App-Layer Protocol Defines...
- Types of messages exchanged,
	- request, response
- Message syntax:
	- What fields in messages & how fields are delineated
- Message semantics
	- Meanings of information in fields
- Rules for when and how processes send & respond to messages
