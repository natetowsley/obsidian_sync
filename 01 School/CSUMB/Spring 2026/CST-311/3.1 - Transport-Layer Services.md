# Transport Services and Protocols
- Provide logical communication between *application processes* running on different hosts
- Transport protocols actions in end systems:
	- **Sender**: Breaks application messages into *segments*, passes to network layer
	- **Receiver**: Reassembles segments into messages, passes to application layer
- Two transport protocols available to Internet applications
	- TCP, UDP

# Transport vs. Network Layer Services
- **Analogy:** 25 kids in Alice's house sending letters to 25 kids in Bob's house

- In this example:
	- Hosts = houses
	- Processes = kids
	- App messages = letters in envelopes
	- Transport Protocol = Alice and Bob who demux to in-house siblings
	- Network-layer Protocol = postal service
- **Transport Layer**: Communication between *processes*
- **Network Layer**: Communication between *hosts*
## Transport Layer Actions
### Sender
- Is passed an application-layer message
- Determines segment header fields values
- Creates segment
- Passes segment to IP
### Receiver
- Receives segment from IP
- Checks header values
- Extracts application-layer message
- Demultiplexes message up to application via socket
## Reliability and Connection-Oriented
- **Reliability**: Ability of the transport protocol to ensure that data is delivered accurately, completely, and in the correct order from the source to the destination
- A "connection-oriented" transport layer protocol establishes a dedicated and reliable connection between two devices before data exchange begins
	- Reliability guaranteed

# Two Principal Internet Transport Protocols
- **TCP: Transmission Control Protocol**
	- Reliable transport between sending and receiving process
	- Flow control: Sender won't overwhelm receiver
	- Congestion control: Throttle sender when network overloaded
	- Does not provide: Timing, minimum throughput guarantee, security
	- Connection-oriented: Setup required between client and server processes
- **UDP: User Datagram Protocol**
	- Unreliable data transfer between sending and receiving process
	- Does not provide: Reliability, flow control, congestion control, timing, throughput guarantee, security, or connection setup
## Why UDP?
- Not all applications tolerate TCP
- Low overhead
	- Efficient for transmitting small packets of data without complexities of TCP's additional requirements
- Reduced latency
	- Due to its simplicity
	- Suitable for real-time applications where minimizing delays is crucial (online gaming, live streaming, ...)
