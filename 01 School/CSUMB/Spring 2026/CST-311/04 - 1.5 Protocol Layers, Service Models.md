# Protocol "layers"
- Networks are complex with many "pieces"
	- Hosts
	- Routers
	- Links of Various Media
	- Applications
	- Protocols
	- Hardware, Software

# Problem Scenario
![[Pasted image 20260206104656.png|450]]
- It is a burden to implement a new application or a new service if we need to handle their compatibilities with all existing supported services
## More Problems
![[Pasted image 20260206104722.png|450]]

# Solution: Use Indirection
- Using network abstraction layer(s)
	- Provide APIs and interfaces for new application and media
![[Pasted image 20260206104816.png|450]]

# Layered Network Stack
- Modularity
	- Does not specify an implementation
	- Instead, tells us how to organize functionality
- Encapsulation
	- Interfaces define cross-layer interaction
	- Layers only rely on those below them
- Flexibility
	- Reuse of code across the network
	- Module implementations may change
- Unfortunately, there are tradeoffs
	- Functionality duplications
	- Interfaces hide information
	- As we will see, may hurt performance

# Key Questions
- How do we divide functionality into layers?
	- Routing
	- Security
	- Congestion control
	- Fairness
	- Error checking
	- etc
- How do we distribute functionality across devices?
	- EX: Who is responsible for security?

# The ISO OSI Model
- OSI: Open Systems Interconnect Model
![[Pasted image 20260206110008.png]]
- All devices implement three layers:
	- Network
	- Data link
	- Physical
- Layers communicate peer-to-peer
## Layer Features
![[Pasted image 20260206110152.png]]
- Service
	- What does this layer **do**?
- Interface
	- How do you **access** this layer?
- Protocol
	- How is this layer **implemented**?
### Physical Layer
- Service
	- Move information between two systems connected by a physical link
- Interface
	- Specifies how to send one **bit**
- Protocol
	- Encoding scheme for one bit
	- Voltage levels
	- Timing of signals
- EX: Coax cable, fiber optics, radio frequency transmitters
### Data Link Layer
- Service
	- Data framing: boundaries between packets
	- Media access control (MAC)
	- Per-hop reliability and flow-control
- Interface
	- Send one **packet** between two hosts connected to the **same** media
- Protocol
	- Physical addressing (e.g. MAC address)
- EX: Ethernet, WIFI, DOCSIS
### Network Layer
- Service
	- Deliver packets across the network 
	- Handle fragmentation/ reassembly
	- Packet scheduling
	- Buffer management
- Interface
	- Send one packet to a specific destination
- Protocol
	- Define globally unique addresses
	- Maintain routing tables
- EX: Internet Protocol (IP), IPv6
### Transport Layer
- Service
	- Multiplexing/ demultiplexing
	- Congestion control
	- Reliable, in-order delivery
- Interface
	- Send message to a destination
- Protocol
	- Port numbers
	- Reliability/error correction
	- Flow-control information
- EX: UDP, TCP
### Session Layer
- Service
	- Access management
	- Synchronization
- Interface
	- It depends...
- Protocol
	- Token management
	- Insert checkpoints
- EX: none
### Presentation Layer
- Service
	- Convert data between different representations
	- E.g. big endian to little endian
	- E.g. Ascii to Unicode
- Interface
	- It depends...
- Protocol
	- Define data formats
	- Apply transformation rules
- EX: none
### Application Layer
- Service
	- Whatever you want
- Interface
	- Whatever you want
- Protocol
	- Whatever you want
- EX: Turn on your smartphone and look at the list of apps
#### Notes on Presentation and Session Layers
- Internet stack "missing" **presentation** and **session** layers
	- These services, if needed, must be implemented in application

# Encapsulation - How does data move through the layers?
![[Pasted image 20260206111147.png||450]]

# TCP/IP Model
![[Pasted image 20260206112338.png]]
## Encapsulation, Revisited
![[Pasted image 20260206112414.png|450]]
## Orthogonal Planes
- **Data Plane**: How data is **forwarded** over Internet paths
![[Pasted image 20260206112457.png||500]]

# Reality Check
- The layered abstraction is very nice
- Does it hold in reality? **NO**
