# UDP: User Datagram Protocol
- "Best effort" service, UDP segments may be:
	- lost
	- delivered out-of-order to app
- **Connectionless**:
	- No handshaking between UDP sender and receiver
	- Each UDP segment handled independently of others
- **Simple and Fast:** No connection state at sender, receiver
	- Small header size
	- No congestion control
	- UDP can blast away as fast as desired
- UDP use:
	- Streaming multimedia apps (loss tolerant, rate sensitive)
	- DNS (usually through port 53)

# Checksum
- **Goal**: detect errors (i.e., flipped bits) in transmitted segment

## UDP Checksum
- **Goal**: Detect errors in transmitted segment
- Sender:
	- Treat contents of UDP segment (including UDP header files and IP addresses) as sequence of 16-bit integers (padded with zero at the end if necessary)
		- Not including the checksum field

### Why Taking 1's Complement (Flipping Bits)?
- To make the verification step easier
	- Compute the sum (using one's complement arithmetic) all 16-bit words. The expected result, including the checksum word, should be:
		- `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
			- Not equal -> Error Detected
			- Equal -> No error detected, but maybe errors nonetheless?
	- Although UDP provides error checking, it does not do anything to recover from an error
		- Some implementations of UDP simply discard the damaged segment; others pass the damaged segment to the application with a warning
	- Instead of calculating the checksum again and then comparing the calculated value with the checksum field in the header (which is in the middle of the summed data)
### Example
- Adding two 16-bit integers:

- When adding numbers a carryout from the most significant bit needs to be added to the result
### Weak Protection!

- Cannot detect error in this case
