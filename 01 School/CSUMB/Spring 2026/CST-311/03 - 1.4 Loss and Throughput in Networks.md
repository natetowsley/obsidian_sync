# How do Loss and Delay Occur?
- Packets *queue* in router buffers
	- Packet arrival rate to link (temporarily) exceeds output link capacity
	- Packets queue, wait for turn

# Packet Loss
- Queue (aka buffer) preceding link in buffer has finite capacity
- Packet arriving to full queue dropped (aka lost)
- Lost packet may be retransmitted by previous node, by source end system, or not at all

# Throughput
- **Throughput:** rate (bits/time unit) at which bits transferred between sender/ receiver
	- **instantaneous:** rate at given point in time
	- **average:** rate over longer period of time

## Instantaneous Throughput

## Average Throughput
- If the file consists of F bits and the transfer takes T seconds for the destination host to receive all F bits, then the **average throughput** of the file transfer is
$$F/T{\text (bits/second)}$$
## Bottleneck Link
- $R_s < R_c$   What is the average end-end throughput in ideal scenario?
![[Pasted image 20260204140758.png|450]]
- ANSWER: $min\{R_s,R_c\}$
- **Bottleneck Link:** Link on end-end path that constrains end-end throughput
> "A chain is only as strong as its weakest link"

# Throughput: Internet Scenario
- Per-connection end-end throughput:
$$min(R_c, R_C, R/3)$$
- In practice:
	- $R_c {\text \:or\: } R_s$ is often bottleneck
	- $R/3$ because we have 3 connections within $R$

# Bandwidth, Latency/Delay, and Throughput

| **Latency/Delay**                                             | **Bandwidth**                                      | **Throughput**                                                                                    |

| The time it takes for a signal to propagate through a network | Maximum data transfer rate of a network connection | The actual amount of data that is successfully transferred over a network within a period of time |
| Typically measured in **milliseconds**                        | Usually measured in **bit per second (bps)**       | Typically measured in the **same units as bandwidth**                                             |

# Impact Factors
- **Latency:** Distance, congestion, protocol, efficiency, infrastructure
- **Throughput:** Bandwidth, processing power, packet loss, network topology

# Latency vs Throughput
- **Latency:** Usually measure the time it takes for a single data packet to travel from the source to the destination
	- Often measures the round-trip time (RTT): The time it takes for a data packet to travel from the sender to the receiver and then back from the receiver to the sender
- Throughput measures the amount of data transferred per unit of time
- They are not directly interchangeable or used to calculate one from the other

# Summary
- **Latency** is about the delay or time taken for data to travel
- **Bandwidth** is the maximum data transfer rate of a network connection
- **Throughput** is the actual amount of data successfully transmitted over the network
> These are important measurements of a network. Optimizing each of these aspects is crucial for achieving a well-performing and efficient network
