# The Network Core
- Mesh of interconnected **routers**
- **packet-switching**: hosts break application-layer messages into packets
	- forward packets from one router to the next, across links on path from source to destination
	- each packet transmitted at full link capacity

# Packet Switching
## Store-and-Forward
- **store and forward:** entire packet must arrive at router before it can be transmitted on next link

## Queueing Delay, Loss
- **queueing and loss:** if arrival rate (in bits) to link exceeds transmission rate of link for a period of time:
	- packets will queue, wait to be transmitted on link
	- packets can be dropped (lost) if memory (buffer) fills up
	- depends on congestion level of router

# Two Key Network-Core Functions
- **routing:** determines source-destination route taken by packets
- **forwarding:** move packets from router's input to appropriate router output

# Alternate Core: Circuit Switching
- end-end resources allocated to, reserved for "call" between source & destination:
- In diagram below, each link has four circuits
	- call gets 2nd circuit in top link and 1st circuit in right link
- Dedicated resources: no sharing
	- Circuit-like (guaranteed) performance
- Circuit segment idle if not used by call (no sharing)
- Commonly used in traditional telephone networks

# Packet Switching VS Circuit Switching
- Packet switching allows more users to use network!
- EX:
	- 1 Mb/s link
	- 10 users
	- each user:
		- 100 Kb/s when "active"
		- active 10% of the time
	- **circuit switching**:
		- 10 users
	- **packet switching**:
		- with 35 users, probability > 10 active at same time less than .0004
- Is packet switching a "slam dunk winner?"
	- great for bursty data
		- Resource sharing (links, queues, buffers etc.)
		- Simpler, no call setup
	- Excessive congestion possible: Packet delay and loss
		- Protocols needed for reliable data transfer, congestion control
	- How to provide circuit-like behavior?
		- bandwidth guarantees needed for audio/video apps
		- still an unsolved problem

# Network Architecture
- Defines the physical and logical framework of a computer network
- Includes hardware, software, transmission media (wired or wireless), network topology, and communication protocols
- There are two types of network architecture:
	- Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
	- client/server
## Client/Server Network
- A central server/groups of servers manage resources and deliver to client devices in the network
	- Server: Provide the service
	- Client: needs to access service
- The clients in the network communicate with other clients through the server

## Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network
- Two or more computers are connected as "peers"
	- Having equal powers and privileges on the network
	- Does not require central server
	- Each computer acts as both a client and server
