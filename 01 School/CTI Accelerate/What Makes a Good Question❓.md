# Steps for Creating a Good Question
## Step 1: Identify the Core of your Question
- Clarify the question as much as possible, there should be little to no room for interpretation
	- "How does a car move?" bad question
		- What kind of car
		- What motor
		- etc.

## Step 2: Research the problem
- Before asking, google it, have ChatGPT explain it to you, check Stack Overflow
- Sometimes it can prove beneficial to turn your initial question into a clarifying question after researching a topic
	- Shows initiative, and that you took the extra step to do your research

## Step 3: Ask Peers or on Available Platforms
- Slack, Discord, LinkedIn
- Any source you have, anyone you know, find an answer

## Step 4: Ask Mentors or Senior Positions if all else fails
- If the question is incredibly important to the success of the project, ask your senior
- They don't always have the answer, or the time to answer
	- Make sure any question you ask them is the best possible question you can ask
