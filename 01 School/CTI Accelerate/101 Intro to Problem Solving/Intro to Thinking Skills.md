# Convergent Thinking
- Convergent thinking is the process of coming up with the best answer to a question using our memory, resources around us, or logic
- This thinking skill does not require significant creativity or lateral thinking strategies
	- It is a very straightforward thought process
- Multiple choice tests for example
- The key elements required to be a skilled convergent thinker are:
	- Speed
	- Accuracy
	- Logic

# Divergent Thinking
- Divergent thinking is the exact opposite of convergent thinking
- Involves coming up with solutions, paths forward, or new ideas when there is no single correct answer
- Often encouraged in children, to play or use their imagination

	- When you don't have all the exact information at hand
	- Critical thinking of patterns, clues, methodologies
- **Abduction**

	- An educated guess

# Creative Thinking
