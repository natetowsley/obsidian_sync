## Ups and Downs in your journey/ how you made it through all that
- Meta cut staff/ didn't offer full time positions after internship in 2022
- Put herself out there
	- Career fairs
	- Recruiters
	- Got multiple job offers this way
- Challenges before getting first internship
	- Be delusional about your confidence level
	- Have to work with what you have as far as experience
## Day in the life as a Woman in tech
- Doesn't feel gender bias in industry as much as she did at University
- Works fully in person
- Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner at office
	- Team often goes to lunch together
- Team standups/ more code in afternoon
- A lot more collaborative of a job than she thought it would be
## How do you use AI day to day?
- Does not use it as a replacement for her abilities
- Doesn't use it if it could end up becoming more work for her
	- Hallucinations with LLMs and so on
- Uses it everyday, mainly for auto-complete, but not super frequently
## How do you feel about AI's impact on your learning/ growth?
- Thinks it's a tool that is becoming very widespread
- Makes sense to have a basic and working understanding of it
- Believes it will become more of a tool for engineers than a replacement for said engineers
	- Thinks the skills that set a software engineer apart from a replaceable programmer are what separates the role from being able to be replaced by AI
		- Believes these are skills that come with experience
## What kind of experiences/resume points do you think made you stand out?
- It's less about the actual experience, more about being able to tell a story with it
- Nothing special about her resume, but her ability to show skills through explaining her experiences is what made her stick out
## How were you able to start your own projects while feeling not ready?
- Groups provide accountability aspect to learning new skills
- At a certain point you just have to go for it
## If you had to reapply for Google Step, would you change anything about how you applied?
- If you can get a referral, that really helps
	- Makes you application different than the majority
## What was the interview process like for both Google and Meta?
- First, OA (online assessment)
	- Coding challenge submitted remotely
	- Then offered a call for next internship
- All Leetcode for interview
- Intern projects aren't always very cool
- More about learning how to work in a company
## If you were to restart your journey with the AI tools available today, would you change how you learned?
- Would be very useful to learn the backend of AI a little more than others
	- How does it work
- Important to remember that you can't use it in interview
## Is there anything you feel students aren't focusing on for the internship landing process that they should be?
- Being a person is underrated
- Being kind, personal, intentional, makes you stand out
## What's the best way to get your syntax down in a new/unfamiliar language?
- Youtube crash course
- Tutorials
## What clubs/activities were you involved in at Berkley?
- Business/ cs club
	- Built a website
- Women in tech club
- EECS Honor Society
	- Built a community
	- Free tutoring
### Was that competitive to get into?
